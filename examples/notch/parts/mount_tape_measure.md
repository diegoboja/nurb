Ported from Fusion `Mount - Tape Measure - 2x` v9.

## What it is

Holds a tape measure by its belt clip. An open U capture band, front rail plus two
side rails, with the slab itself as the back. The clip's spring leaf drops into the
46.32mm wide, 6mm deep slot from the top and the closed ends stop it sliding off
sideways. The band runs the full slab height, so the front reads as one flush 28mm
wall.

It is the smallest part in the library and the one that pins two kernel numbers,
because at its defaults it sits on both of them: `2 * structural_chamfer` is exactly
the slot's depth and `2 * chamfer_size` is exactly the front rail's thickness.

## Design notes

- **Grounded and full height.** The band spans the whole slab, z -28 to 0, so the
  part is a vertical extrusion with a vertical slot and prints bottom down with no
  support and no overhangs. The slot cut runs 1mm past both ends, which keeps the
  mouth open at the top and keeps the cut's end faces off the block's own, since
  coincident faces make brittle booleans.
- **Slab and band are one block.** They are flush in y and z, so together they are a
  plain 14 x 50.32 x 28 block and the slot is what makes them a band. Fusion needed
  BandOuter, Band, SlotProfile and Slot as four features; here it is a box and a cut,
  and building it that way means there is no fuse of two face-touching solids to go
  wrong.
- **The plate is the standard bracket span.** `slab_width = bracket_count *
  BLOCK_WIDTH` is 50.32mm, just wide enough for the two mounting channels and the
  same dovetail margin as the rest of the family. `opening` is derived from it,
  `slab_width - 2 * band_wall` or 46.32mm, still far wider than any clip needs. Both
  are expressions in the body rather than parameters: Fusion had no way to name a
  derived value except as another parameter, and a second parameter that has to agree
  with the first is a parameter that will eventually disagree.
- **`structural_chamfer` is 2mm, not the family 3mm, and the number is measured.**
  The four inside corners of the slot each sit at one end of a slot side face that is
  `band_reach - band_wall` = 6.00mm long. Two chamfers need strictly more than twice
  their size of face between them, so 3mm has exactly nothing to land on: it fails
  with "Failed creating a chamfer, try a smaller length value(s)" and 2.99mm builds.
  Raising `band_reach` to 8.01, so the slot is 6.01mm deep, makes 3mm build. The rule
  is `2 * structural_chamfer < band_reach - band_wall`, strictly, and the part raises
  a `ValueError` saying so rather than letting OCCT say it.
- **The whole slot rim is sharp**, top and bottom, back, sides and front. Fusion
  chamfered the front rail's rim on both sides for a little roof ridge and OCCT will
  not build it, for the same reason at a different number. Bisected: all six polish
  edges chamfer fine on their own and exactly one pair fails, the block's front top
  edge at x=-14 and the slot's front rim at x=-12. They are `band_wall` = 2.00mm apart
  across the top face and `2 * chamfer_size` = 2.00. 0.999mm builds. The rim joins the
  back and side segments and stays sharp instead, which is also what a 2mm rail wants:
  two 1mm chamfers leave a knife ridge with no flat on top, and a knife-edge top layer
  prints ragged.
- 0.50:1 projection over height and a light load, so no gussets.
- Tuning handles: `band_wall` is wall thickness and also shrinks `opening`,
  `band_reach` sets slot depth at `band_reach - band_wall`, and `item_height` is
  28mm because that is the minimum for full bracket engagement, with the band
  following it.
- Verified: channel floors at x=-4.2 with y-centers exactly 0 and 25.16, each floor
  the full 21.06mm span. Flexes 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 and up to 5 with one solid, exact
  pitch and an unchanged sliver baseline every time.

## Accepted

Two faces under 1mm2, both of them the corner triangles where three 1mm chamfers meet
at a convex corner, at the two front-top corners of the block. That number was
predicted from the polish set before it was measured: five edges survive the vetoes,
two front verticals, the front top edge and the two side top edges, and the only place
three of them meet is those two corners. A third face is the polish pass cutting
something it should not.

The thinnest section is 1.0mm, behind the detent dimple: 6mm slab less the 4.2mm
channel less the 0.8mm dimple. Same as `hook_scissors`, and a consequence of the fit
geometry rather than a choice.

`nurb check` reports six `concave_cosmetic` warnings on this part and they are all
false positives. Four are the 2mm structural chamfer faces themselves, which are what
that rule says the answer is; the other two are the 2mm slot side walls left standing
between each pair of chamfers, which are walls and not bevels at all. The rule finds
polish by strip width against `2 * cosmetic_chamfer * 1.42` = 2.84mm, and a 2mm
structural chamfer face measures 2.57mm by that formula, so it cannot tell the two
apart without knowing what `structural_chamfer` is. `mount_akrobin_rail`, the other
part in the library that uses 2mm, fires the same rule. There is no `[accepted]`
count for it the way there is for slivers, so the findings are left standing rather
than papered over.

## Don't

- **Don't widen the plate off-pitch to fit a wider item.** Raise `bracket_count`
  instead. The plate was 54mm before v9 and got cut back to `bracket_count *
  BLOCK_WIDTH`, because a plate that is not a whole number of brackets wide loses the
  dovetail margin the rest of the family has and buys nothing.
- **Don't put a lead-in chamfer on the bottom edges or corners.** Removed on
  2026-07-22 as a product-line decision across four parts: the facets it leaves are
  tiny and print badly. `polish_edges` already vetoes the bottom face, so this is
  about not reaching around it.
- **Don't raise `structural_chamfer` to the family 3mm.** It has exactly nothing to
  land on at the default `band_reach`, and the part will tell you so. If you want 3mm,
  `band_reach` has to go to 11 first, which costs 3mm of projection.
- **Don't chamfer the slot rim,** front included. See Design notes for the pair that
  collides and the 0.999mm that builds. Shrinking the polish to sneak it in would
  break the family's one chamfer size for a ridge nobody asked for.
- **Don't bring back `loop_height`, `loop_back` or `loop_rise`.** They date from v1
  and v2, when the band was a 14mm-tall closed racetrack loop partway up the slab.
  Since v3 the band is an open U grounded to the bed and since v9 it runs the full
  slab height, so `loop_height` was `item_height` under another name and the other two
  had no geometry left to drive.
- **Don't close the loop with a back band.** v3 retired it on the grounds that the
  wall can be the back. A back band would double the material and put a wall between
  the clip and the slab for no gain.
- **Don't thin the front rail to loosen the clip's grip** without a print behind it.
  It was written down as the second lever after the detent and never applied, and at
  2mm the rail is already at the doctrine's minimum wall.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-26: ported to nurb. Bounding box matches the Fusion v9 exactly, 50.32 x 28 x
  14mm, and the two channel floors land on exact pitch. `loop_height`, `loop_back` and
  `loop_rise` dropped as vestigial, `slab_width` and `opening` demoted from parameters
  to expressions. The front rail's rim chamfer is gone: OCCT will not build two 1mm
  chamfers on a 2mm face, so the whole slot rim is sharp now rather than three sides
  of it. Sliver baseline is 2.

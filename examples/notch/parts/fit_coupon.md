## What it is

The hanging interface with nothing attached to it: one channel, one detent dimple, a
30mm slab. A tool for dialing `SIDE_CLEARANCE` against a real bracket, not a part
anyone hangs anything on.

Print a ladder of them at different clearances, slide them all onto the same bracket,
keep the one that feels right, then set the constant in `system.py`. Each is about
2.6cm³, so a four-rung ladder is one short print rather than four hooks.

## Design notes

- `side_clearance` is a real parameter here rather than the system constant, which is
  the whole point. `channels()` takes it so the coupon can build a fit the library
  does not ship.
- Widening it moves both dovetail walls by the same amount, so they stay at exactly 45
  degrees whatever you pass. The depth clearance is not like this: `CHANNEL_WIDTH -
  CHANNEL_NECK == 2 * CHANNEL_DEPTH` only holds at `CLEARANCE` 0.2, and the 45 degrees
  is what lets the dovetail print without support. Side clearance is the free knob.
- The value is raised on the front face, not cut into it. The web in front of the
  channel is only 1.8mm and debossing would take a third of it. It is also the reason
  the coupons are worth labelling at all: four of these come off the plate identical.
- 30mm slab matches the light-part default, so the coupon engages a bracket the same
  way a hook does.

## Accepted

The raised label is lettering, and lettering is made of small faces. All 65 are in
the glyphs; the coupon itself has no chamfers and so no corner triangles. The number
tracks whatever the label says, so a coupon built at a different clearance or bracket
count will not match it. That is tolerable here in a way it would not be on a real
part: this is a gauge, and the only surface that has to come out right is the channel.

**`min_wall` is switched off here, and that is a statement about the rule rather than
about the part.** The ray cast finds the label before it finds anything structural: it
cannot tell a relief from a wall, so it returns the lettering's 0.5mm stand-off, and on
a machine with a different system font it returns that font's stroke instead. Measured
0.500 on one build and 0.480 on another, of the same part, at different places in the
same word. No threshold can be both meaningful and stable against that.

The walls that matter here are not in doubt and are not the ones being measured: the web
in front of the channel is 1.8mm, and the section behind the detent dimple is 1.0mm, the
same as every 6mm slab in this library. Both are fixed by the fit geometry rather than
chosen, and neither depends on a font.

## Don't

- **Don't orient these differently from the part you are comparing against.** Print
  orientation changes the effective size of the slot, so a coupon laid down one way
  and a hook laid another are not measuring the same thing. Slice them the way you
  sliced the hook.
- **Don't use this to dial multi-bracket parts.** One channel constrains yaw over its
  own 21.56mm; four constrain it over 75mm. The same clearance that wobbles on a 1x
  hook is fine on a 4x shelf, which is the whole reason this got noticed on the hook
  first.
- **Don't tighten `CLEARANCE` (depth) to fix a loose fit.** It breaks the 45 degree
  walls. See Design notes.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-26: **0.25 settled.** 0.20 printed too tight to seat, 0.30 slid on loosely,
  so the usable window is about 0.1mm wide and 0.25 is the middle of it. That width is
  the same order as FDM extrusion variation, which is the real reason to stop here:
  the printer moves further between prints than a finer increment would.
- 2026-07-26: 2x, 4x and 6x all printed at 0.30 and all slid on, the 6x easily. Run
  length needs no allowance at all, so the scaling is gone and every channel on every
  part is one number. Three versions of that scaling were built and all three were
  compensating for scatter the wall does not have. Base clearance now going below 0.30
  since even a 6x feels a touch easy.
- 2026-07-26: ladder printed. **0.30 is the number**, and `SIDE_CLEARANCE` moved 0.5
  -> 0.3. Clearance is now per-channel rather than per-system, so the coupon takes
  `bracket_count`.
- 2026-07-26: created, after a printed `hook_scissors` came out loose side to side.
  The shipped `SIDE_CLEARANCE` was 0.5mm per side, which is generous for FDM and
  disagrees with the Notch constants table's stated 0.2. Ladder exported at 0.20 /
  0.30 / 0.40 / 0.50.

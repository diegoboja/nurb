Ported from Fusion `Holder - Needle Files - 2x` v7.

## What it is

Snap-clip bar for the Bambu Lab 4-piece needle file set. A minimum-height 28mm slab on
two brackets, with a 6mm-tall ledge running the full width along its bottom, carrying
four keyhole clips. Each clip is a 3.5mm round pocket reached from the front through a
2.9mm throat with a 45 degree flared mouth. Push a file in horizontally, its 2.88mm neck
spreads the throat and snaps into the round pocket, and the handle shoulder lands on the
ledge top. Pull forward to remove.

The handle stands up in front of the slab and the blade hangs about 75mm below the
ledge, so leave that strip of wall clear.

The round pocket being wider than the throat is the whole retention mechanism. There are
no bumps, no sprung tabs and no separate detents in the clip.

## Design notes

- **`throat_width` 2.9 is print-validated. Do not touch it.** It is deliberately wider
  than the 2.88mm neck Josh calipered, because FDM prints a slot about 0.2mm undersized,
  so the effective throat lands near 2.7 and gives about 0.1mm of bite per side. That is
  meant to be light: the file only has to be held, not gripped. Josh on the print that
  came off these numbers: the front opening is great, perfect. If a reprint still fights,
  go to 3.0. If files fall out, go to 2.8. Nothing else in the clip moves with it.
- **`seat_width` 3.5 is a second fit pass, tuned independently of the throat.** It went
  3.1 to 3.3 to 3.5 across two prints, the last step because the pocket wanted to be a
  hair looser once the throat was right. Seat and throat are separate numbers on purpose,
  since one sets how hard the file goes in and the other sets how it sits.
- **`pocket_inset` is measured from the ledge's front face to the pocket centre**, so at
  the shipped numbers the centre is at x = -17.0. `finger_root_inset` is measured from
  the same face, which puts the relief back and the finger root at x = -12. The Fusion
  card states this one dimension three ways and the three do not agree; see the changelog
  for which was kept and why.
- **The flex arm is 5.98mm**, from the finger root at x = -12 to the pocket-throat
  transition at x = -17.98. That transition is where the pocket arc meets the throat
  wall, `pocket_inset + sqrt((seat_width / 2)^2 - (throat_width / 2)^2)` back from the
  front face, and it is the last point the neck has to squeeze past. About 1.5% strain
  at full spread, which PLA takes, and the spread is in the layer plane because the clips
  are cut vertically through the ledge, so snapping a file in never peels layers apart.
- **The fingers are made by subtraction.** The ledge starts as a plain full-width bar and
  the clips are cut out of it: `clip_count` keyholes for the seats, `clip_count + 1`
  reliefs for the air gaps between them. Nothing is built up finger by finger, so the
  fingers cannot drift out of alignment with the seats and there is no pattern to keep
  in step.
- **The weight path is the ledge, not the fingers.** A file's handle shoulder rests on
  the ledge and finger tops, 6mm above the bed, and the fingers only resist a forward
  pull-out. That is why 1.5mm fingers are safe on a part that carries four files.
- `relief_width` is `clip_pitch - seat_width - 2 * finger_thick`, 7.5mm at the shipped
  numbers, so one relief plus two fingers plus one seat is exactly `clip_pitch`. It is
  derived rather than a parameter, because a fourth independent number here would just
  be a way to make the row not add up.
- **`item_height` 28 is the system minimum**, 25mm of bracket plus the 3mm `TOP_MARGIN`
  that is the stop. There is no reason for this part to be taller: the projection ratio
  is 0.73, which is deep inside the chamfers-only band.
- **`clip_pitch` 14** leaves about 1.5mm between 12.5mm handles. The outermost handles
  overhang the plate edges by about 2mm, which is air and fine. Growing the pitch means
  growing the plate.
- The ledge is buried 1mm into the slab, so its back face is at x = -5.0 and it
  interpenetrates the slab over that millimetre, which is what makes the fuse one solid.
  That is 0.2mm short of `MERGE_X`, on the safe side of it, and it is what pins the
  projection at exactly 20.5 given a 15.5mm ledge on a 6mm slab. Do not reach further
  back: the channel floors are at -4.2 and filling them takes the part off the wall.
- **There is no pattern anchor and no unsigned-dimension trap.** The Fusion part had to
  sketch the rightmost keyhole and pattern at a negative spacing, because a leftmost
  anchor goes negative at three brackets and Fusion will not take a negative distance
  dimension. Here the positions are a list comprehension around `span(bracket_count)`, so
  the trap has nothing to catch on and the row stays centred at any count.
- `structural_chamfer` 3mm at the ledge root, the one concave junction the load runs
  through, found with `new_edges` rather than by coordinate so it survives flexing
  `bracket_count`. It lands between x = -6 and -9, well clear of the reliefs, which stop
  at -12.
- **The cosmetic pass is the slab's top face and nothing else**, three edges at 1mm. Two
  measured reasons, in Kernel notes below.
- Verified: one solid at every count tried, channel floors at x = -4.2 with y centres on
  exact 25.16 pitch and the full 21.06mm span, bounding box 20.5 x 50.32 x 28.0 to the
  micron. Flexes `bracket_count` 2 to 4 to 1 to 2 and `clip_count` 4 to 6 to 2 to 4, with
  the two out-of-range combinations raising rather than building something bent.

### Kernel notes

- **A 1mm polish cannot go anywhere on the clip band, and the finger is why.** The two
  ledge-top edges bounding one finger are `finger_thick` apart. Each chamfers cleanly on
  its own at 1mm. Together they fail, and the threshold is exact: at `finger_thick` 1.5
  the pair builds at 0.749 and fails at 0.750, and at `finger_thick` 2.0 it builds at
  0.990 and fails at 1.000. So the rule is `2 * chamfer_size < finger_thick`, strictly,
  with no slack at all. The doctrine's floor for a cosmetic chamfer is 0.8mm, which needs
  1.6mm of finger, so no chamfer this library is allowed to use fits on a 1.5mm finger.
  The clip band is not sliver bait, it is a hard veto.
- **The slab-front verticals do not fail in OCCT, contrary to the Fusion card.** Fusion
  could not blend them because they share their bottom vertices with the structural
  chamfer; OCCT builds them without complaint. What they actually cost is two 0.866mm2
  corner triangles at the top front corners, where a third chamfer would then meet the
  two top-face ones. They stay out because the print that Josh signed off was built
  without them and this part has no slivers to its name, not because the kernel refuses.

## Accepted

Zero faces under 1mm2, which was the prediction before it was measured. The cosmetic
pass touches three edges, all of them on the slab's top face, and no vertex on that face
has three chamfers meeting at it: the two front corners each have two, because the
slab-front verticals are left sharp. Three chamfers at a corner is what makes the
0.866mm2 triangle the doctrine allows, so with none of those there is nothing small on
this part at all. A single sliver here is a regression, and the first place to look is
whether something added an edge in the clip band.

The thinnest section is 1.0mm, behind the detent dimple: a 6mm slab less the 4.2mm
channel less the 0.8mm dimple. It is the same wall every part in this library has and it
prints. The ray cast does not report the 1.5mm finger, which is thicker.

## Don't

- **Don't touch `throat_width` 2.9.** It is the one number on this part that a human
  approved by handling the print. If the fit needs work, move it by 0.1 in the direction
  the design notes give and reprint. Do not "fix" it because 2.9 looks wider than the
  2.88mm neck it holds: that is the point, and the printer supplies the interference.
- **Don't go back to a 2.7 throat.** That was v4, and it printed VERY tight and hard to
  get files into. The 0.09mm of design bite plus about 0.2mm of slot shrinkage was twice
  the intended interference.
- **Don't add retention bumps.** v3 built the clips as pairs of sprung fingers with bumps
  on their tips, and v4 deleted the whole idea. The pocket being wider than the throat is
  already the detent, it is round, which is what the files are, and it has no small
  features to print badly.
- **Don't build the fingers additively.** They are what is left after the keyholes and
  reliefs are cut out of a solid bar. Modelling them as parts and joining them puts the
  seat position and the finger position in two places that can disagree.
- **Don't make it a drop-through brick.** v1 and v2 were a 29mm-deep block with four
  staggered holes wedging the tapered handles. It was never printed and was retired the
  same day as way overkill for four files.
- **Don't chamfer anything in the clip band, at any size.** Ledge top edges, keyhole
  rims, relief walls and finger roots are all out. The kernel refuses at any chamfer the
  doctrine permits, and the finger roots would be wrong even if it did not: a relief
  there stiffens the exact hinge the clip works by.
- **Don't deepen the ledge burial.** One millimetre into a 6mm slab already fuses, and it
  leaves 0.8mm between the ledge back at -5.0 and the channel floor at -4.2. Spend that
  0.8mm and the ledge starts filling the dovetail, which is a part that will not go on the
  wall and still builds, exports, checks clean and looks right. It would also move the
  projection off 20.5, which is the number the print was measured at.
- **Don't grow `clip_pitch` without growing the plate.** 14mm already overhangs the
  outermost handles by about 2mm. The part raises rather than cutting seats off the end
  of the ledge, and the error names both fixes.
- **Don't drop `item_height` below 28.** It is the system floor for full bracket
  engagement, not a style choice, and there is nothing to gain: this part is already at
  it.
- **Don't add a bottom or back chamfer to make the ledge look finished.** The bottom is
  the first layer over the whole 20.5mm of projection and the back sits on the wall.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-26: ported to nurb. Bounding box matches the Fusion v7 exactly
  (50.32 x 28.0 x 20.5mm, ratio 0.73) and the sliver check is clean at zero.
  Four things changed in the port:
  - **`pocket_inset` is now one definition instead of three.** The Fusion card gives the
    same dimension as `pocket_inset` 3.5, as a pocket centre 14.5mm from the back face,
    and as a flex arm of about 5.8mm running back from x = -12 to a transition at about
    x = -17.8. Read as "front face of the ledge to the pocket centre", 3.5 puts the
    centre at x = -17.0 and the transition at -17.76 at the seat 3.1 and throat 2.7 the
    v4 sketch was dimensioned on, which is the card's -17.8 and a 5.76mm arm. So the
    first and third statements agree with each other at the old numbers, and the second
    would put the centre at x = -14.5, 6.0mm from the front face, agreeing with neither.
    The second was dropped. At the shipped seat 3.5 and throat 2.9 the same definition
    gives a transition at -17.98 and an arm of 5.98mm, which is the number to compare
    against from now on. Projection stays at exactly 20.5.
  - **`clip_count` is a parameter, defaulting to 4.** Fusion froze it in a pattern
    feature. Nothing here needs it frozen, and the reliefs and seats both come off it.
  - **Two brackets is now a floor, not a warning.** Fusion built at `bracket_count` 1
    and warned that the seed cuts fell off the slab. Here it raises, because a build
    that quietly drops half its clips is worse than a build that stops: four clips at
    14mm pitch want a 48.5mm plate and one bracket is 25.16mm. `bracket_count` 1 with
    `clip_count` 2 builds fine, and the error says so.
  - **The clip band is a hard chamfer veto rather than a matter of taste**, with the
    threshold measured. See Kernel notes.
  One trap found and worth knowing, because it produced a part that built, reported the
  right bounding box and was wrong: `Polygon` takes its face normal from the winding of
  the points it is given, and `extrude` follows that normal. The throat profile was first
  written clockwise, so it extruded downward, landed a millimetre under the part, cut
  nothing, and left four plain round holes with no throats and no mouths at all. The
  bounding box, the solid count, the sliver count, the channel fit and `nurb check` were
  all exactly what a correct part reports. What caught it was measuring a seat: the
  cylindrical face came to 65.97mm2, which is a full 360 degrees, and a seat with a
  throat opening into it can only be 248.

Ported from Fusion `Holder - Pliers - 6x` v4.

## What it is

A row of five 20x20mm square through-pockets for pliers and flush cutters, stored
handles-down and jaws-up. The handles drop through the pocket and the wider head
catches on the rim, so retention is head-catch plus gravity and nothing else.

Structurally it is a 6mm slab, full 30mm tall for bracket engagement, with a 15mm
pocket block at the bottom of it. Above the block the pocket region is open air, which
is the point: a curved or odd-shaped handle leans out through the gap instead of
fouling a wall. Full-height 30mm walls were tried in Fusion and rejected for exactly
that reason.

## Design notes

- **Two parameters were renamed on the way in.** The Fusion card calls the block's 30mm
  projection `item_depth` and the 6mm slab `slab_depth`, which is backwards from every
  other part in this library, where `item_depth` is the slab. Here `item_depth` is 6.0
  and the projection is `block_depth` 30.0. Nothing about the geometry changed. The two
  catalogs have to be read with that substitution in mind.
- **Pocket pitch is head clearance, not structure.** Divider thickness is
  `pocket_pitch - pocket_size`, and it is set by how wide two plier heads are where they
  sit side by side at the rims, not by what the divider needs to stand up. 30mm pitch
  gives 10mm dividers, which was chosen over 35mm because 15mm dividers looked wasteful.
  Flush-cutter heads at about 24mm keep a 6mm gap; two 30mm plier heads will just touch,
  so stagger the wide ones.
- **5 pockets at 30mm pitch is 140mm on a 150.96mm plate, so the end walls are 5.48mm.**
  That is the constraint that decides `bracket_count` on this part, and it is guarded:
  anything that leaves less than 3mm of end wall raises a `ValueError` naming both fixes.
  The widest pitch 6 brackets will take is 31.24mm, which is why the Fusion card says
  anything wider needs 7.
- **Pockets are dimensioned from the front face back.** `front_wall` 3mm is the number
  that has to hold, so the pocket runs x=-27 to x=-7 and the web behind it is what is
  left: 2.8mm between the pocket and the channel floor at x=-4.2. That web is thin on
  purpose and the second guard protects it at 2mm.
- **The pockets are cut through the full height, not just through the block.** This is
  the one place the port diverges from the Fusion timeline and it is not cosmetic. See
  the first two entries under Don't: the Fusion order does not build in OCCT at all, and
  the version that does build leaves the structural relief bridging over the pocket
  mouths.
- Projection over height is exactly 1.00, well inside the no-gusset band, so the only
  reinforcement is the 3mm structural chamfer where the block meets the slab. That
  junction is the full-width concave edge at x=-6, z=-15 and it carries the whole
  moment. `new_edges` returns it exactly, which is what keeps it correct when
  `bracket_count` moves.
- **The cosmetic pass subtracts nothing.** Chamfering a concave edge leaves two
  shallower concave edges rather than a convex one, so the structural relief vetoes its
  own boundary through `polish_edges`, and the 20 pocket-corner verticals are inside
  corners for the same reason. The pocket top rims are convex and do get polished. Fusion
  needed an explicit exclusion list for all of this and it is what broke on a resize.
- **`wall_height` 15mm** is a grab-versus-retention tradeoff. Research says 25 to 35mm
  for maximum anti-flop and it was halved for odd-shaped handles. If tools flop, raise
  it; the block grows upward and stays grounded on the bed.
- Detent dimples on all six channels, because pulling a wedged cutter out is an upward
  yank.
- Verified: six channel floors at x=-4.2 with y-centers exactly 0, 25.16, 50.32, 75.48,
  100.64 and 125.8, every floor the full 21.06mm span. Flexes 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 6 on
  `bracket_count` and 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5 on `pocket_count` with the sliver baseline
  unchanged at every step.
- Volume is 39980mm3, which is the 40cm3 the Fusion v3 changelog recorded.

## Accepted

Four faces under 1mm2, all of them the 0.866mm2 corner triangles where three 1mm
chamfers meet at a convex corner. Two are at the block's front-top corners and two at
the slab's top-front corners. The Fusion part has two, because it left the slab's two
front corner verticals unpolished; that exclusion is not carried over, so this part has
four. See Don't. A fifth means the polish pass has started cutting something it should
not.

The thinnest section is 1.0mm and there are two of them at that number. One is behind
the detent dimple, 6mm slab less the 4.2mm channel less the 0.8mm dimple, exactly as on
every other part in the library. The other is the lip at the back of each pocket, where
the structural relief is trimmed by the pocket wall. Both are consequences of fit
geometry rather than choices.

## Don't

- **Don't cut the pockets before the structural chamfer.** That is the Fusion timeline
  order and OCCT refuses it outright with "Failed creating a chamfer, try a smaller
  length value(s)". The relief sits on the concave edge at x=-6 and runs forward across
  the block top, but the pocket back wall is at x=-7, so there is exactly 1.0mm of face
  for it to land on. Measured: it builds at `structural_chamfer` 0.99 and fails at 1.00,
  so the threshold is the face width exactly. Chamfer first, then cut, and the pockets
  carve the relief instead of blocking it.
- **Don't stop the pocket cut at the block top either.** It builds, but the relief then
  bridges 3mm forward over each pocket mouth as a 2mm ledge with nothing under it, and
  the polish pass on that geometry fails at every chamfer size from 0.4mm up: the
  pocket's side rim and the outer edge of the bridge meet at a corner OCCT cannot build,
  and shrinking the chamfer does not help because the collision is topological rather
  than a room-between-edges problem. Cutting through the full height removes the bridge
  and leaves a 1mm lip carried to the bed.
- **Don't raise `chamfer_size` past 1.4mm.** The relief remnant behind each pocket is a
  45 degree face 1.414mm long with only one polishable edge, so the polish needs to stay
  under that. 1.4 builds, 1.5 fails on the lip crest alone, and it fails alone rather
  than in a batch, which is unusual here and means it is a face-too-narrow problem and
  not a pair of chamfers colliding.
- **Don't deepen `block_depth` into the band that puts the pocket's back wall just in
  front of the relief's toe.** The toe lands at `x = -(item_depth + structural_chamfer)`,
  which is -9 at the defaults. A pocket ending behind it, as the shipped one does at -7,
  simply trims the relief. A pocket ending more than `chamfer_size` in front of it is
  clear. In between there is a strip of block top too narrow to carry the 1mm rim
  chamfer, and OCCT says only "try a smaller length value(s)". Measured: `block_depth`
  33.0 fails and 33.01 builds, so the threshold is `chamfer_size` exactly. Both this and
  the structural threshold above are the one-edge form of the doctrine's clearance rule,
  where the neighbouring edge is concave and therefore never polished, so the room needed
  is `chamfer_size` rather than twice it.
- **Don't widen `pocket_pitch` past 31.24mm on 6 brackets.** The pockets run off the
  plate. The part raises a `ValueError` naming both the bracket count that would fit and
  the pitch that would, rather than failing in the chamfer.
- **Don't shrink the 2.8mm web behind the pockets.** It is what the dovetail hangs on.
  Deepening the pocket or shortening the block eats it, and both are guarded at 2mm.
- **Don't put a floor in a pocket.** Through-pockets are self-supporting, shed dust, and
  let a long handle hang below the part in front of bare wall. A tool whose head and
  closed handles both fit inside 20mm will fall through; that wants a narrower
  `pocket_size` variant, not a floor. Spring-handled flush cutters splay and wedge, so
  they are fine.
- **Don't restore full-height 30mm pocket walls.** They were cut to 15mm mid-build in
  Fusion because curved handles need somewhere to lean.
- **Don't add clips or springs.** Head-catch plus depth is what commercial and printed
  racks converge on. Springy retention wears out.
- **Don't rely on the Fusion catalog's parameter names.** `item_depth` there is this
  part's `block_depth`, and `slab_depth` there is this part's `item_depth`.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-26: ported to nurb. The bounding box matches the Fusion v4 exactly
  (151 x 30 x 30mm, 40cm3) and the projection ratio is the same 1.00. Four changes:
  `item_depth` and `slab_depth` swapped names so `item_depth` means the slab as it does
  everywhere else in this library, and the projection is now `block_depth`; the pockets
  are cut through the full height rather than only through the block, because the Fusion
  order does not build in OCCT; the slab's two front corner verticals are polished
  rather than excluded, which raises the sliver baseline from 2 to 4 and buys back the
  two chamfers Fusion's selector could not hold; and Fusion's explicit polish exclusion
  list is gone, since `polish_edges` vetoes concave edges by itself. The Fusion card
  counts 24 concave pocket-corner verticals, which is the 6-pocket geometry it had
  before v3; at 5 pockets there are 20.
- The Fusion history this came from: v4 widened the channel mouths after a print bound
  on the outer brackets, which was a System Base bug and is not a thing this library can
  have, since `channels()` reads one clearance and every part shares it. v3 cut 8
  brackets to 6 and 6 pockets to 5 at a tighter 30mm pitch. v2 was the initial build,
  during which the pocket walls went from full height to 15mm.

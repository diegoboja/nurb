Ported from Fusion `Holder - Calipers - 2x` v11.

## What it is

A drop-in cradle for the common 20 to 40 dollar digital calipers. The caliper hangs
beam-down, display out, jaws up: drop it in beam-first through the 35mm `beam_slot`
between the two saddle posts until the slider housing's bottom edge lands on the
saddles. The head sits in a 10mm-deep pocket between the slab and the front lip, leaning
back against the slab, and the beam hangs free below the part. Lift straight up to
remove.

**The saddles are deliberately uneven, and that is the whole part.** The housing's bottom
edge is straight and square to the beam, but the thumb roller pokes well below it on one
side, spanning from the beam edge clear out to the housing corner. A symmetric cradle
always sits crooked, tilting toward the roller, and there is no clean edge outboard of
the roller to relieve around. The fix is a floor differential. The -y post's saddle sits
at `saddle_height` 24mm above the bed and catches the clean housing edge; the +y post's
sits at `saddle_height - roller_relief`, 9mm, and catches the roller. Roller low plus
edge high is level.

**Handedness matters.** Insert display out. Display in puts the roller on the +y side's
high saddle and the caliper sits crooked, by design rather than by accident.

## Design notes

- **`roller_relief` 15mm is a tune-on-print parameter.** The differential has to *equal*
  the roller's protrusion below the housing edge. Deeper does not help: the roller is
  the only contact on the +y side, so the tilt is protrusion minus differential, signed.
  Sits tilted left, raise it. Tilted right, lower it. Josh sized 15mm empirically against
  his own caliper, up from a 4mm photo estimate. A vernier caliper with no roller tilts
  by about the whole differential; this part is tuned for the digital clone family.
- **Standard-width slab**, `bracket_count * BLOCK_WIDTH` = 50.32mm, with no decoupled
  slab width. The posts are flush with the slab edges and every y position derives from
  `span(bracket_count)`, which is what lets the count flex. Each post is
  `(width - beam_slot) / 2`, 7.66mm at the default.
- **`beam_slot` 35mm** leaves a roughly 40mm housing about 2.5mm of edge per side. That
  works under a 160g caliper and it is not much margin. Past about 38mm the part wants a
  third bracket.
- **Pocket depth is `cradle_depth - lip_thickness`**, 10mm, sized to the housing
  thickness at the resting zone and not to the display bump. Josh trimmed it 20 to 16 to
  10 against his caliper. A thicker head or a dial caliper wants `cradle_depth` back up.
- **The lip tops out flush with the slab, at z=0.** A taller lip would poke above the
  slab and bridge over the beam slot, whose opening starts at z=0. There is no
  `lip_height`; see Don't.
- **The beam slot is open through the lip**, so the posts are two separate extrusions
  rather than one block with a slot cut through it. The gap between them is the slot.
  Nothing is cut, which is also why the slot cannot drift off the bracket midpoint.
- **Both posts are corbeled, at exactly 45 degrees.** `_post_section` draws a
  `corbel_tip` 4mm vertical face below the saddle floor at the front, then a 45 degree
  plane falling back into the body, and the landing point falls wherever 45 degrees puts
  it. The two posts take different forms out of the same arithmetic: the high post's rise
  (20mm) is longer than its run (14.8mm to the merge plane), so it roots partway up the
  slab front at z=-24, 6mm above the bed; the low post's rise is 5mm, so it lands on the
  bed 5mm back and keeps a footprint. Both print support-free, layers growing forward off
  the slab face or off the bed. The form switches on `rise <= run` rather than on a
  parameter, so a resize that flips the relationship gets the other form for free and the
  guard the Fusion card asked for is not needed.
- **Structural chamfers, 3mm, at four junctions**: each saddle floor where it lands on
  the slab front and where it meets its own lip, at both floor levels. The slab welds
  come from `new_edges`; the lip roots are interior to the post profile, so they are
  selected by coordinate before any chamfer has moved the topology.
- **Cosmetic edges running into a structural corner are left sharp.** Ten of them: each
  post's two saddle floor side edges, its two lip back verticals, and the slab's own
  front corner above each saddle floor. At the shipped numbers OCCT builds either way, so
  this is a quality call rather than a kernel workaround. It takes the sliver count from
  10 to 4 and it keeps a 1mm facet from having to blend into the end of a 3mm band. What
  it costs is visible: the slab's front vertical corner stays sharp for the 6mm above the
  high saddle and the 21mm above the low one.
- The saddle posts merge into the slab at `MERGE_X`, -5.2, which is 0.8mm behind the slab
  front and 1mm clear of the -4.2mm channel floors. Fusion used -5.0. The 0.2mm goes the
  safe way, away from the dovetails, and `MERGE_X` is the constant this library states
  the limit with.
- **Load is trivial.** 20mm of projection on a 30mm back is a ratio of 0.67 against a 2.5
  limit, and the caliper is about 160g, so there are no gussets and there should not be.
  The hanging caliper is a pendulum with its center of gravity well below the saddles, so
  it cannot tip out on its own. The lip only guards against knocks.
- Detent dimples in both channels. Removal is a straight upward lift with no grip on the
  part, so the detent is belt and braces here rather than load bearing.
- Verified: channel floors at x=-4.2, y centers exactly 0 and 25.16, each floor the full
  21.06mm span. Flexes 2 to 4 to 3 to 5 to 2 with one solid, four slivers and the floors
  on exact pitch every time. `bracket_count` 1 is refused; see Accepted.

## Accepted

Ten faces under 1mm2, every one a 0.866mm2 corner triangle where three 1mm chamfers meet
at a convex corner. That is the only tiny face the doctrine allows outright, and an
eleventh, or any face smaller, means the polish pass has started cutting something it
should not.

It was four until 2026-07-27, when the corner-blend exclusion came out. The six that
arrived are the two lip back top corners per post and the slab's two front top corners,
which is exactly what predicting the count from the exclusions had said they would be.

The thinnest section is 1.0mm, behind the detent dimple: a 6mm slab less the 4.2mm
channel less the 0.8mm dimple. It is a consequence of the fit geometry rather than a
choice, and it prints.

This part is why `bed_bevel` knows what a corbel is. It fired at the low post's corbel
underside, 46.4mm2 of it, which the doctrine requires to be exactly 45 degrees and lets
land where it lands. The rule looked for a tilted face touching the plate and could not
tell that from a chamfer band, so every bed-landing corbel in the library would have
tripped it. It now measures how far the face rises off the bed, which separates them
exactly: a bottom chamfer rises by its size, 1.00, 2.00 and 3.00mm for chamfers of those
sizes, against 4.29mm here. Rise also stays honest around a circular or diagonal edge,
where the face's plan-view bounding box says nothing about the chamfer width.

Two findings it raised alongside that one *were* real and are fixed rather than accepted.
The 1mm cosmetic chamfers on the low post's corbel side edges ran down to the plate at 45
degrees and laid two 9.3mm2 tilted facets into the first layer. `polish_edges` vetoed an
edge lying in the bottom face and correctly allowed a vertical corner that merely ends
there, because that chamfer stands square to the plate; a sloped edge ending on the bed
is the case in between, and it now vetoes that too. This part found the gap, and the fix
is in `system.py` where the rest of the bottom-face rule already lived.

## Don't

- **Don't reintroduce `lip_height`.** It was deleted in Fusion v5. A lip taller than the
  slab pokes above z=0, and since the beam slot's opening starts at z=0 the extra
  material bridges straight across the slot the caliper has to go through. The lip caps
  at the slab top and there is nothing to tune.
- **Don't steepen a corbel or link the two angles.** Fusion tried both and retired both:
  v8 anchored the high post's bottom leg to `min(cradle_depth, saddle_height -
  corbel_tip)`, which pushed it to about 55 degrees, and v9 re-expressed the low post's
  leg as a ratio so the two would match at any parameters. v10 threw both away for plain
  45 everywhere. Mismatched facet angles are a doctrine veto, and the answer is to let
  the landing point float, not to bend the angle.
- **Don't cut a relief pocket under the roller instead.** There is no clean housing edge
  outboard of the roller to land on: the roller reaches the housing corner. The floor
  differential is the only shape that works.
- **Don't taper the beam slot into a V to wedge the beam.** The beam passes all the way
  through, so the slot cannot be narrower than the beam anywhere.
- **Don't chamfer the saddle floors.** They are the bearing surface, and a 40mm housing
  lands only about 2.5mm of edge on a 7.66mm post as it is. A millimetre off each side
  takes a quarter of that. `polish_edges` cannot know which horizontal face is a bearing
  surface, so this part vetoes them by coordinate and has to keep doing so.
- **Don't make the beam slot snug.** Beam widths run 15 to 16.5mm across the family and
  snug-for-all is not possible in a rigid print. If the asymmetric saddle disappoints in
  print, the fully universal answer is a horizontal beam rack, two identical notches
  holding the bare beam, because the beam is the only straight datum every caliper shares.
  That is a different part, not a parameter on this one.
- **Don't deepen the posts' merge past `MERGE_X`.** It fills the dovetails and the part
  will not go on the wall.
- **Don't widen `beam_slot` past about 38mm on two brackets.** Each post already lands
  only about 2.5mm of housing edge. Add a bracket instead. The part refuses outright
  once a post would come out narrower than twice the polish, which is what makes
  `bracket_count` 1 an error: a 35mm slot does not fit in a 25.16mm slab.
- **Don't raise `cradle_depth` to clear the display bump.** The pocket is sized to the
  housing thickness at the resting zone, which is where the head actually touches. Josh
  trimmed it twice to get there.
- **Don't decouple the slab width from `bracket_count`.** Every y position derives from
  `span(bracket_count)`, and a separate `slab_width` would let the posts drift off the
  bracket midpoint the first time the count moved.
- **Don't polish an edge that runs down to the bed at an angle.** The chamfer arrives at
  the plate tilted and lays a knife edge into the first layer. A vertical corner ending
  on the bed is fine; the corbel sides are not.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-27: twelve more edges polished. The exclusion that kept every edge sharing a
  vertex with a structural chamfer sharp was a Fusion habit: OCCT blends those corners
  fine, and testing all four combinations of it built every time. What replaced it is
  narrower and is fit rather than kernel: the two saddle floors stay sharp, because a
  40mm housing lands about 2.5mm of bearing on a 7.66mm post and a millimetre off each
  side of that floor is a quarter of it. Slivers 4 -> 10, all corner triangles. Bounding
  box unchanged.

- 2026-07-26: ported to nurb. Bounding box matches the Fusion v11 card exactly, 50.32 x
  30 x 20mm at a 0.67 projection ratio, and both saddle floors, the corbel root at z=-24
  and the corbel landing 5mm back reproduce their recorded positions. Three things
  changed. The beam slot is no longer a cut: the two posts are drawn separately and the
  gap between them is the slot, which is the same solid with one less boolean. The two
  corbel forms collapsed into one profile that picks its landing from `rise <= run`,
  which retires the geometry guard the Fusion card asked someone to remember. And the
  posts merge at `MERGE_X` (-5.2) rather than Fusion's -5.0. Sliver baseline is 4, and
  `nurb check` is clean, after this part turned up one real polish defect and one rule
  that could not tell a corbel from a chamfer. Both are in Accepted.

Ported from Fusion `Holder - Tall Tools - 5x` v4.

## What it is

A knife-block for tall, skinny, top-heavy bench tools: a deburring tool, two tweezers,
a brass detail brush, two Bambu spudgers. Six blind pockets, 17mm square and 45mm deep,
sit in a block grounded at the bottom of a 55mm slab, with 4mm floors under them.

Tools drop in tip down. That is the point rather than an accident of drawing: tweezer
and deburring points end up buried in the pocket instead of at hand height, and 45mm of
burial holds a top-heavy tool upright while 45 to 90mm of it stays proud to be
identified and grabbed. Retention is gravity. Lift straight up to remove.

## Design notes

- **The slab is the pocket back.** Each pocket cut stops on the slab's own front face at
  x=-6 and no further, so a leaning tool bears on the full 6mm slab and no material is
  spent on a back wall. The two coplanar faces come back from the cut as one face, which
  is why the mouth has a front rim and two side rims and no back rim: there is no edge
  there to polish. Do not reach past x=-6. Behind it is the 1.8mm web in front of the
  channels, and 1.0mm of it behind each detent dimple.
- **Pockets are 17mm square** for a stated thickest item of about 15mm, which leaves 2mm
  of clearance plus shrinkage margin. Everything rattles slightly on purpose. One
  uniform row beats six snug per-tool pockets, because a new skinny tool then just gets
  a slot.
- **`slot_cut` 45 and `item_height` 55** give 45mm of burial, a 4mm floor and a 6mm slab
  reveal above the block, so the block top and the pocket mouths sit at z=-6. The block
  bottom is the bed footprint; nothing runs to the plate only to satisfy printing, so
  there is no corbel.
- **Six slots need five brackets.** The row is `6 x 17 + 5 x 3 = 117mm` on a 125.8mm
  plate, leaving 4.4mm end walls by expression. `bracket_count` flexes up cleanly and
  the end walls simply grow; below 5 the end wall goes negative, so the part raises
  rather than building a broken row.
- **`block_overlap` 1mm is not a round number, it is the room that is left.** The
  block's back face lands at x=-5, which is exactly the floor of the detent dimple.
  More overlap fills the dimple, and a part with a filled dimple builds, checks clean,
  prints, and then does not latch to the wall.
- **The block is flush with the plate at the sides**, so its sides are the slab's and no
  side strip stands beside it. A decoupled slab width would buy two more concave
  junctions and nothing else.
- **No structural chamfer, deliberately.** Opening the pocket backs destroyed the
  full-width block-top to slab-front junction. What is left is seven short concave root
  segments, five divider tops at 3mm and two end-wall tops at 4.4mm, and they carry
  grams: the real tie to the slab is the full-width solid band under the pocket floors.
  They stay sharp, and `polish_edges` already vetoes them for being concave.
  `structural_chamfer` stays in the signature for a variant that closes the backs again.
- Cosmetic pass is 1mm on 28 edges: the slab top loop, the two slab front verticals, the
  block top loop and its two front verticals, and three rims per pocket mouth. Excluded
  are everything within 4.2mm of the back, the bottom face, the pocket interiors and the
  seven root segments.
- Load is a few hundred grams at roughly 12mm of centroid, and the projection ratio is
  0.49, well inside the no-gusset band. Detent dimples in all five channels, since
  removal is a straight upward lift.
- Verified: channel floors at x=-4.2 with y centers exactly 0, 25.16, 50.32, 75.48 and
  100.64, every floor the full 21.06mm span. Flexes 5 to 6 to 7 to 5 with the four-face
  sliver baseline unchanged, and rejects 4, 3 and 2.
- Print bottom down. Every pocket wall is vertical and every pocket floor faces up, so
  the part is self-supporting with no bridge in it.

## Accepted

Four faces under 1mm2, all of them at 0.866mm2, and all four are the corner triangles
where three 1mm chamfers meet at a convex corner. Two are at the slab top's front
corners and two at the block's front top corners, which is every corner on this part
where three polished edges meet. A fifth is a regression.

The prediction is worth writing down because it was made from the exclusions before it
was measured: the two places where two chamfers meet at a corner whose third edge is a
sharp concave root, at the block top's inner side corners and at each pocket mouth's
front corners, resolve into a miter and add nothing. They were the risk and they cost
nothing.

The thinnest section is 1.0mm, behind a detent dimple: 6mm of slab less the 4.2mm
channel less the 0.8mm dimple. That is the hanging interface's own arithmetic rather
than a choice here, and it is the same 1.0mm `hook_scissors` carries.

## Don't

- **Don't cut the pockets past x=-6.** The slab front face is the pocket back, and it is
  also all that is left in front of the channels. Another millimetre takes the web from
  1.8mm to 0.8mm and the wall behind a dimple to nothing.
- **Don't put back walls on the pockets.** They were there in v1 and were removed in v2
  as material for no added benefit. Removing them is what took the projection from 28mm
  to 23mm, and then to 27mm when the pockets grew.
- **Don't re-add the structural chamfer.** It was retired in v2 when the junction it
  relieved stopped existing. This is the trap: at 3mm it still builds, keeps one solid
  and leaves the sliver count at four, so nothing downstream complains. What it actually
  does is drop seven small wedges into the reveal band above the dividers, relieving a
  junction that carries grams.
- **Don't run `slot_wall`, `front_wall` or the end walls down to 2mm.** Both edges of
  each divider top get polished, and two chamfered edges need strictly more than
  `2 * chamfer_size` of face between them. Measured on this part, three times over: a
  2.05mm divider builds and a 2.00mm one raises "Failed creating a chamfer, try a
  smaller length value(s)", identically for `slot_wall`, for `front_wall` and for the
  end wall. The end wall is the one that is guarded, because it is the one that moves
  when a count changes.
- **Don't take the reveal below `chamfer_size`.** The slab top's front edge is polished
  and it lands on that band. At `slot_cut` 49 the reveal is 2mm and it builds; at 50 the
  reveal is 1mm, the same as the chamfer, and the kernel refuses.
- **Don't raise `block_overlap` to get a stronger weld.** Past 1mm it eats the detent
  dimple, and the part is guarded against it.
- **Don't drill the pocket floors out for drainage.** Blind floors were chosen knowing
  they collect dust: these tools have nothing for a rim to catch on, and tweezer tips
  would snag a drain hole on the way out.
- **Don't shrink the pockets to stop something rattling.** They were 13mm in v1 and went
  to 17mm because the thickest item did not fit. Shrink a copy of the part instead.
- **Don't add gussets.** The ratio is 0.49 and the load is a few hundred grams.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-26: ported to nurb. The bounding box matches Fusion v4 exactly
  (125.8 x 55 x 27mm) and the four-face sliver baseline reproduces. Fusion's
  `ChannelTool`, `CombWeb`, `PocketArray` and `DetentDimplesArray` are a loop and an
  import here. The dimple cut moved after the block fuse: the dimple floor and the
  block's back face are the same plane at the default parameters, so cutting first
  would leave the two solids meeting face to face there instead of overlapping.

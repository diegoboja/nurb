Ported from Fusion `Holder - Bambu Scraper - 2x` v13.

## What it is

Holds the stock Bambu Lab scraper, the one that ships with the printers. A compact
hollow box, 50 x 18.5 x 32mm, that works like a coat hook: drop the scraper head into
the open top, slide it forward so the handle sits in the front notch, and the collar's
front wing hooks over the notch sill at z=-14. That sill carries the whole load. The
head hangs free inside the pocket and the anti-kickback ramp on the pocket's back wall
stops the blade swinging back, so the handle stands near vertical. The razor stays
behind the solid front wall below the sill, on a blind 2mm floor. Nothing sharp exits
the part. Lift up and back to remove.

It is the simplest solid in the library and the fussiest set of numbers. There is no
slab and no forward feature: the box is both, and every dimension in it came off a
print rather than out of a calculation.

## Design notes

- **Print-validated.** Josh, 2026-07-22, Fusion v13: "works perfectly". Collar 19mm and
  head 31.9mm off calipers; the 9 x 30 x 35 cavity was fitted across three test prints.
  These are the proven fit, so nothing here gets resized from a spec sheet, a tolerance
  table or an estimate. Only another physical print moves them.
- **Two cuts and one wedge.** `Pocket`, 9mm by `slot_len` 35 in plan, z=0 down to -30,
  hollows the box. `FrontNotch`, `clamp_len` 22 wide through the 3mm front wall, z=0
  down to `sill_depth` -14, makes the hook. `BladeRamp` rises `ramp_rise` 8mm off the
  pocket floor and kicks `ramp_kick` 4mm forward. Fusion needed nineteen timeline
  features to say that; here the pocket depth is not even a parameter, because
  `item_depth - nest_back - front_wall` already is one.
- **The ramp leans the right way.** Its sloped face runs from (-10.5, -30) up to
  (-6.5, -22), so the wedge is thickest at the floor and vanishes at the top. Two things
  fall out of that sense and neither works in reverse: the cavity only narrows going
  down, so every layer lands on the one below and the ramp self-supports with no
  overhang at all, and the blade gets pushed forward rather than back, which is what
  stands the handle up.
- **`slab_width` is decoupled from the bracket run**, at a fixed 50.0 rather than the
  50.32 that two brackets span. It is the only part in the library that does this, and
  the reason is that the usable band has two walls, not one. It is not "wide enough to
  cover the dovetails": at 47mm the plate edge sat 0.64mm from the dovetail pocket wall,
  a sliver Josh caught in the slicer, and above about 54.5mm the plate reached into
  where the next bracket sits on the wall. 50 is the middle of that band.
- **The edge web is 1.89mm here, not the card's 2.14mm.** Fusion measured to the
  dovetail pocket, 20.56mm wide; nurb cuts a channel of `POCKET_WIDTH + 2 *
  SIDE_CLEARANCE`, 21.06mm, so the same 50mm plate leaves 0.25mm less on each side. The
  Fusion numbers reproduce exactly against the pocket width: 25 - 12.58 - 10.28 = 2.14
  at 50mm and 0.64 at 47mm. Against the channel it is 1.89mm at 50mm and 0.39mm at 47mm.
  1.89mm is still a wall; 0.39mm is still a sliver. The conclusion did not move, only
  the number it is written against.
- **Both ends of the band are guarded, and both are physics.** The near end is the
  printable web, `MIN_WEB` 1.0mm beside the outer channel, which puts the floor at
  48.22mm on two brackets against the Fusion card's 48. The far end is where the plate
  reaches the neighbouring bracket's pocket, `(bracket_count + 1) * BLOCK_WIDTH -
  POCKET_WIDTH`, which is 54.92mm on two brackets against the Fusion card's ~54.5.
  Fusion recorded that far end as "clips the third comb lobe". The comb was scaffolding
  and does not survive the port, but the constraint it encoded was the real bracket run
  underneath it, so it does. A third guard catches a `slot_len` that outgrows its plate.
- **`slab_width` stays a declared float and the band moves with `bracket_count`.** The
  alternative considered was defaulting it to `None` meaning "the bracket span", with
  50.0 supplied as this part's value. Rejected on three counts: the viewer infers a
  slider's step from the type of the default and `None` has none; it recouples the one
  dimension this part deliberately decouples; and it would take the print-validated
  number out of the signature, which is the library's only source of parameter truth.
  Auto-widening the plate when the run grows was rejected for a harder reason: it
  silently changes a dimension that three prints paid for. So flexing `bracket_count`
  alone raises, and the message names the band for the count you asked for. A wider run
  is a part nobody has printed, and it should have to say so out loud.
- **Support-free.** The box walls and both cuts are vertical extrusions, the sill is an
  up-facing step on solid material, and the ramp tapers upward. The only downward faces
  on the part are the channel ceilings, which bridge 21.06mm, and the detent dimple
  roofs, which are 0.8mm deep.
- **No structural chamfers, anywhere.** 0.58 projection over height and about 100g of
  load, into a monolithic block with no loaded junction in it: the load runs from the
  sill straight down through solid material and there is no concave weld to relieve.
  Cosmetic 1mm only, which also means there is no structural set to subtract from the
  polish selection the way the hook and the shelf both have to.
- **The polish pass reaches the sill, and that is the one thing to watch.** 1mm off the
  front edge and 1mm off the back leaves 1.00mm of flat sill at z=-14, 22mm wide, with
  45 degree faces either side. The sill height does not move, so the scraper still hangs
  where it hung, and it is not a strength question at this load: 1N over 22mm2 is
  0.045MPa against PLA's ~50. The front chamfer is also the lead-in the wing drops over.
  But Fusion v13 ran one general `Chamfer_Edges` feature and its card does not enumerate
  which edges that caught, so this is the only place the port could differ from the part
  that printed without the bounding box showing it. If a scraper ever seats loose, look
  here before touching `sill_depth`.
- **Detent dimples in both channels.** Removing the scraper is a straight upward pull,
  which is exactly the load the dovetails do not resist.
- Thin section to respect: the pocket's back wall leaves 2.3mm in front of the channel
  floors, and 1.5mm in front of the detent dimples, which is the thinnest measurement on
  the part. `nurb check` finds the same 1.5mm at (-5.0, 25.2, -10.0). Do not shrink
  `nest_back`; the part raises below 6.0.
- Verified: one solid, 58 faces, channel floors at x=-4.2 with y-centres exactly 0 and
  25.16 and every floor the full 21.06mm span. Bounding box 18.5 x 50.0 x 32.0mm, which
  is the Fusion card's 50.0 w x 32.0 h x 18.5 proj in nurb's X-Y-Z order, and the
  projection ratio matches at 0.58.
- Flexed 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2. At 3 and at 1 the fixed 50mm plate is outside that count's
  band and the part raises. Given a plate inside the band the geometry flexes cleanly:
  1 bracket at 29mm with a 20mm pocket, 3 at 75mm and 4 at 100mm all build to one solid
  with floors on exact pitch and the same 6 slivers, so nothing in the polish selection
  is frozen to two channels.

## Accepted

Six faces under 1mm2, all of them 0.866mm2, and all six are the corner triangles where
three 1mm chamfers meet at a convex corner. That is the only tiny face the doctrine
allows outright.

Six was also the prediction, made before measuring, and where they are is the part of it
that carries information. Every convex corner on this part with three polished edges
running into it is on the top face, and there are exactly six: the two front corners of
the box, and the four corners of the front notch's mouth, at (-18.5, 1.58) and
(-18.5, 23.58) where it breaks the front face and at (-15.5, 1.58) and (-15.5, 23.58)
where it meets the pocket. The measured centroids land on all six. Everything else is
excluded or mitres away. The four back corners of the box each have two of their three
edges vetoed, one lying in the back face and one in the bottom. The pocket rim corners
and the two sill step corners have only two polished edges apiece and OCCT mitres those
without leaving a face. The seven concave edges around the sill, the pocket floor and
the ramp apex never enter the set at all. A seventh sliver means the polish pass has
started cutting something it should not.

The thinnest section is 1.5mm, between the pocket's back wall and a detent dimple:
`nest_back` 6.5 less the 4.2mm channel less the 0.8mm dimple. It is a consequence of the
fit geometry rather than a choice, and it is 50% more material than `hook_scissors`
carries in the same place.

## Don't

- **Don't reopen the bottom.** The blind `floor_thick` 2mm floor is what keeps a razor
  blade enclosed, and v5 exists only because the first version had an open slot down
  there. If the blade ever bottoms out, raise `item_height` or shallow `sill_depth`. Do
  not cut through. The part raises when `sill_depth` reaches the pocket floor rather
  than quietly building a holder that drops its blade on the floor.
- **Don't widen the cavity to the replacement-blade spec.** `slot_len` 35mm is
  deliberately narrower than the 39.5mm a replacement blade measures. The stock blade
  and the hang geometry fit at 35 on Josh's print, which is the only evidence that
  counts. This looks like a bug in a spreadsheet and is not.
- **Don't add lead-in chamfers to the bottom edges.** Retired on 2026-07-22 as a
  product-line decision across four parts, this one, `hook_scissors`,
  `mount_tape_measure` and `shelf_basic`, because tiny compound facets print badly on
  someone else's machine. Removing them also killed a full-width bottom bevel artifact.
  `polish_edges` already vetoes the bottom face; do not reach around it.
- **Don't shrink `nest_back`.** It is not front-to-back clearance, it is the wall in
  front of the dovetails. At 6.5 it leaves 2.3mm to the channel floor and 1.5mm to the
  detent dimple. If the head binds front to back, thin `front_wall` to 2.5 instead.
- **Don't recouple `slab_width` to `bracket_count * BLOCK_WIDTH`.** Every other part in
  the library does that and this one must not: 50.32 is inside the band, so it would
  build and print, and the reason 50.0 is there would be lost the first time anyone
  flexed it. The band is 48.22 to 54.92 on two brackets and the far end is only 2.1mm of
  overhang per side.
- **Don't reverse or soften the ramp.** Kicking the blade backward instead of forward
  lets the handle lean out, which is the defect v11 was cut to fix, and a wedge that
  widens going up is an overhang the printer cannot lay down.
- **Don't add gussets, structural chamfers or a second mount point.** At 0.58 the part
  is nowhere near the 1.5 where reinforcement starts, and there is no junction to
  reinforce. The Fusion v11 changelog records a "rebind scare" that led to the chamfers
  being rebuilt; that was Fusion's stateful selectors, not a real weakness.
- **Don't resize anything from a spec sheet.** Every dimension on this part is a print
  result. Three test prints are in the numbers.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-26: ported to nurb. The bounding box matches Fusion v13 exactly at
  18.5 x 50.0 x 32.0mm and the projection ratio at 0.58. Nineteen timeline features
  become three cuts and a chamfer pass: `ChannelTool`, the comb, `CombWeb`, `JoinComb`
  and the two array features have no equivalent here, and the pocket depth stopped being
  a dimension because `item_depth - nest_back - front_wall` already was one. Geometry is
  otherwise unchanged. The Fusion card recorded no sliver baseline; it is 6, predicted
  and then measured. The edge web beside the dovetail reads 1.89mm rather than the
  Fusion card's 2.14mm, because nurb's channel is 0.25mm per side wider than the pocket
  Fusion measured against. Both ends of the `slab_width` band are now guarded in code
  instead of living in a design note, and the far end generalises from "the third comb
  lobe" to the next bracket on the wall, so it moves with `bracket_count`.

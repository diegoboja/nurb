Ported from Fusion `Holder - Filament Spool - 2x` v2.

## What it is

A wall holder for 1kg to 3kg filament rolls. The spool hangs by its center bore on a
bar that projects 160mm forward: lift the roll, pass the bar through the bore, set it
down. The top of the bar is a full half-cylinder of radius `arm_width / 2`, so the bore
rides a smooth crest and the roll spins freely when filament is pulled. The bottom stays
flat and square on the bed. A 10mm nose at the tip stops the roll walking off the end.

It is the library's longest reach by a wide margin, and the only part whose whole shape
is set by a load path rather than by what it holds.

## Design notes

- **Sized from real spool data.** A SUNLU 3kg roll is 242mm across, 96.7mm wide, with a
  62.9mm bore; a typical 3kg tops out near 300mm across and 110mm wide; a standard 1kg
  bore is about 52mm. That gives `usable_length` 120mm from the ramp base to the nose
  back face. Spool diameter never enters into it, because the flange plane is parallel
  to the wall and the roll hangs in free air above and below the part.
- **The bore has to clear two sections, and the tight one is the tip.** The ride zone is
  22 wide by 36 tall with the crest rounded off, whose widest straight line is 38.3mm.
  Under the nose the section is square, 22 by 46, a 51.0mm diagonal, and that is what
  has to pass through a 52mm 1kg bore. 1mm of margin is the reason `nose_height` is 10
  and not 12: tall enough that the bore cannot bounce over it, short enough that loading
  is a straight-on push with no tilting.
- **Load path.** Worst case is 3kg pushed up against the nose, putting the roll's center
  of gravity about 112mm out, roughly 3.3 N.m at the wall. `item_height` 65mm holds
  projection over height at 2.46, just inside the 2.5 cantilever ceiling, and the 45
  degree root ramp is the gusset that carries the moment into the slab as compression.
  Stress in the bar itself is negligible, about 0.4 MPa against roughly 50 MPa PLA
  yield. The wall interface is the limit, which is why this is a 2x with the bar centered
  on the bracket span rather than a 1x with a stiffer bar.
- **The ramp is 45 degrees by construction.** `ramp_run` is `item_height - arm_height -
  RAMP_GAP` and the rise is the same number, so the two are equal whatever the other
  parameters do. It is an expression rather than a parameter for that reason.
- **`RAMP_GAP` 3mm.** The ramp stops 3mm below the slab top. That leaves the slab-top
  front edge one clean full-width chamfered edge instead of three pieces, and it holds
  the arm-root relief's top vertex clear of that edge's own 1mm polish band.
- **Print**: the bar bottom runs at bed level the whole 160mm, so it is grounded and
  support-free. The half-round crest and the 45 degree ramp are top surfaces, so there
  are no overhangs anywhere. The crest will show layer stepping, which does not matter
  to a bore resting on it.
- **The crest is built by intersecting two fillets, not by one.** See Don't; a radius of
  exactly half the width on both top edges at once is the geometry the part wants and
  the one thing OCCT will not do.
- **Chamfer conflicts resolved by leaving sharp**, following the calipers precedent. The
  two sloped ramp flanks share their top vertex with the 3mm arm-root relief, so they
  stay sharp. The crest's two tangent lines stay sharp because they are tangent rather
  than convex and a chamfer there would cut a flat into the surface the bore rides on.
  The nose-base junction, where the ride zone meets the nose, stays sharp rather than
  taking a structural chamfer: the geometry there is already the round, and the axial
  load a spool puts on it is grams.
- Detent dimples in both channels. Lifting a 3kg roll off the bar is a straight-up pull
  on the part, so the anti-lift detent earns its place here more than anywhere else in
  the library.
- Verified: channel floors at x=-4.2 with y-centers exactly 0 and 25.16, each floor the
  full 21.06mm span. Flexes 2 to 4 and back with the sliver baseline unchanged. One
  bracket is refused, and the message says why.

## Accepted

Six faces under 1mm2, all of them the 0.866mm2 corner triangles where three 1mm
chamfers meet at a convex corner: two at the slab's top front corners, two at the nose
top's front corners, two at the nose top's back corners. That is the only tiny face the
doctrine allows outright, and it is the same count the Fusion part carried, which is
what confirms the polish exclusions match. A seventh means the pass has started cutting
one of the three junctions that are meant to stay sharp.

The thinnest section is 1.0mm, behind the detent dimple: 6mm slab less the 4.2mm channel
less the 0.8mm dimple. It is a consequence of the fit geometry rather than a choice, and
it is the same 1.0mm every part in the library carries.

The ray cast reports 1.42mm rather than 1.0mm here, and the gap is worth knowing about
rather than trusting. Its probes on the dimple floor land at y = plus and minus 1 from
each dimple's center, and at both of those the arm-root chamfer has already thickened
the wall behind them, so the ray leaves through a 45 degree face 1.42mm out. The 1.0mm
wall is real and sits a millimetre further out at y = -3 to -1.42, where nothing samples
it. Treat a clean min_wall as "no thin walls found".

## Don't

- **Don't fillet both crest edges in one call.** The crest is meant to be a true
  half-cylinder, which means a radius of exactly `arm_width / 2` on both top edges. OCCT
  refuses that outright, and the brief's suggested dodge of `arm_width / 2 - 1e-6` fails
  too. Bisected: the largest radius that builds is 10.999995 on an 11.0 half-width. Every
  radius that does build leaves a land along the top, and the land is either a sliver
  (0.0012mm2 at the largest buildable radius, 0.024mm2 at 10.9999) or a flat you can see
  (0.02mm wide at 10.99). Fillet each top edge on its own copy of the blank and
  intersect the two instead. One edge at a time is fine because the radius is then half
  the face rather than all of it, and the two quarter rounds meet tangent with no land at
  all. The intersection also keeps the runout where each fillet dies into the ramp, which
  is an 11mm scallop at the sides; a cutting tool sized to the ride zone would leave a
  hard 26mm2 lip there instead.
- **Don't build the second half with `mirror`.** `fillet(top) & mirror(fillet(top))`
  produces a solid with the same volume, face count and edge count as
  `fillet(top) & fillet(bottom)`, and it is not interchangeable with it. Chamfering the
  nose-back corner on the mirrored side then fails with "Failed creating a chamfer" at
  1.0, 0.5 and 0.1mm, at `bracket_count` 2 and nowhere else, because the failure depends
  on where the arm has been translated to. The mirrored copy carries a reversed surface
  that the chamfer algorithm chokes on at some positions and not others. This cost an
  afternoon and it is invisible in every number a card prints.
- **Don't deepen `arm_overlap` past 1mm.** The bar's y-band is 1.58 to 23.58, which
  overlaps both channel dovetails, so the arm's back face at x=-5 is only 0.8mm clear of
  the x=-4.2 floors. Deepen it and the dovetails fill in and the part will not go on the
  wall. Shrink it to zero and the arm only touches the slab and fuses to two loose
  solids. The part raises rather than letting either happen quietly.
- **Don't "fix" the back face to `MERGE_X`.** x=-5 is 0.2mm behind the library's -5.2,
  and that is the Fusion part's `arm_overlap` of 1mm rather than an oversight. The thing
  that actually matters is checked directly: every channel floor comes out the full
  21.06mm span at every bracket count this part accepts. Moving it to -5.2 would change
  nothing visible, since the whole overlap is buried in the slab, so there is no reason
  to spend a dimension the Fusion original set.
- **Don't widen the bar without redoing two sums.** The crest radius is exactly
  `arm_width / 2`, so the fillet needs `arm_height` above that radius, and the tip
  section's diagonal has to stay under the 52mm bore it is meant to pass through. At
  `arm_width` 22 that diagonal is already 51.0mm.
- **Don't put it on one bracket.** A 22mm bar on a 25.16mm slab leaves a 1.58mm strip
  either side, which cannot carry the 3mm arm-root relief plus the 1mm polish on the
  slab's own corner. The part raises with the arithmetic rather than failing inside the
  chamfer. The load case says the same thing from the other end: a 3kg roll 112mm out on
  a single bracket twists.
- **Don't chamfer the ramp-to-slab edge along the top.** It is concave and it looks like
  it wants the same 3mm relief the two vertical legs get. It does not: a 3mm band on it
  runs the full `RAMP_GAP` up the slab front face and lands exactly on the slab top edge,
  and OCCT refuses. Measured, on its own and alongside the legs, which makes no
  difference: 3.0mm fails, 2.5mm and below build. `new_edges` already leaves the edge out,
  because it existed on the arm before the fuse rather than being created by it, so this
  is a trap for whoever reaches for a geometric selector instead.
- **Don't chamfer the crest tangent lines.** `polish_edges` will offer one of them: the
  junction is tangent rather than convex, and `is_convex` splits on the pair, calling one
  concave and the other convex. Chamfering what it offers puts a flat down one side of a
  symmetric crest and not the other.
- **Don't raise `usable_length` past 122.5 without raising `item_height`.** Projection is
  `item_depth + ramp_run + usable_length + nose_thickness` and the ratio ceiling is 2.5,
  so 65mm of back buys 162.5mm of reach and the part already spends 160 of it.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-26: ported to nurb. Bounding box matches the Fusion v2 exactly (50.32 x 65 x
  160mm, ratio 2.46) and the six-sliver baseline reproduces. The crest changed
  construction: Fusion's `BarRound` was one fillet feature at r = `arm_width` / 2 on both
  top edges, which OCCT will not do at any radius that is also tangent, so it is now the
  intersection of two single-edge fillets. `ChannelTool`, `CombWeb`, `JoinComb` and the
  detent pattern vanish into `system.py`. `ramp_run` and `arm_length` stay expressions.

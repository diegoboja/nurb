Ported from Fusion `Hook - Scissors - 1x` v4.

## What it is

Single-channel J-hook for hanging scissors by their finger holes. A 6mm arm projects
28mm forward at the bottom of the slab with a 15mm upstand at the far end; the
scissors drop into the cradle the two of them make.

It is also the simple case in this library. The gridfinity shelf is the part that
tests the kernel; this one exists so that a failure over there is unambiguously a
kernel problem and not unfamiliarity with the API.

It carries the whole hook family. `Hook - Utility - 1x` and `Hook - Utility Long - 1x`
are this function at a wider cradle and a longer reach, so they ship as variants rather
than as two more copies of the same J. The catalog names survive as the variant names,
which is what an export is named after.

## Design notes

- Bottom-weighted: the arm and upstand sit on the floor of the slab, so the load
  hangs under the channel stop rather than levering against it.
- 30mm slab is the light-part default: 28mm for full bracket engagement plus 2mm
  spare. The 0.93:1 projection-to-height ratio is inside the no-gusset band.
- The J is drawn once as a section on `Plane.XZ` and swept. The Fusion original built
  it as two extrusions plus a chamfer feature; one polygon says the same thing and
  keeps the arm and upstand in one solid, so their junction is an interior edge.
- Structural chamfers are 3mm at the two concave junctions the load runs through.
  The arm-to-slab weld comes from `new_edges`, which reports exactly what the fuse
  created, so it stays correct when `bracket_count` moves.
- **Across the weld, not around it.** The relief goes on the full-width edge where the
  arm's top meets the slab, and not on the two 6mm vertical legs at the arm's sides.
  Those carry almost none of the moment, and a 3mm band on them eats the strip of slab
  standing beside the arm: at the utility hooks' 20mm cradle that strip is 2.58mm and
  a 3mm band cannot land on it at all. Relieving the weld alone is what lets a
  wide-cradle hook exist on one bracket.
- The strip beside the arm still has to carry the polish on the slab's own front
  corner, so it has to be wider than `chamfer_size`. Measured: builds at 1.08mm, fails
  at 1.00mm, and flush (no strip at all, a cradle the full width of the slab) is fine
  again. The part raises rather than letting OCCT say it.
- The cosmetic pass is 1mm on everything `polish_edges` allows, minus the edges the
  structural pass just made.
- Verified: channel floor at x=-4.2, y-center exactly 0, floor span the full 21.06mm.
  Flexes 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 with the floors landing on exact pitch every time.
- Sliver baseline is 6 faces at 0.866mm², all of them the corner triangles where
  three 1mm chamfers meet. That is the same count the Fusion part carried, and it
  is what confirms the polish exclusions match.

## Accepted

Six faces under 1mm2, and all six are the corner triangles where three 1mm chamfers
meet at a convex corner. That is the only tiny face the doctrine allows. A seventh
means the polish pass has started cutting something it should not.

The thinnest section is 1.0mm, behind the detent dimple: 6mm slab less the 4.2mm
channel less the 0.8mm dimple. It is a consequence of the fit geometry rather than
a choice, and it prints.

## Don't

- **Don't chamfer the channel mouths.** The 1.5mm lead-in was retired on 2026-07-22
  because it made tiny compound facets that print badly on other people's machines.
  `polish_edges` already excludes them; do not add them back.
- **Don't run a feature's back face behind x=-4.2.** It fills the dovetail and the
  part will not go on the wall. `MERGE_X` is the constant to use.
- **Don't chamfer the detent dimple.** Its walls are 0.8mm, so a 1mm chamfer fails
  outright, and it is fit geometry regardless.
- **Don't lengthen the slab to fix a projection ratio without checking it first.**
  v1 was 45mm and got cut to 30mm for looking wrong on a small hook.
- **Don't chamfer the vertical legs of the arm-to-slab weld.** It looks like the same
  junction and it caps the cradle at 17mm on one bracket, which is narrower than two
  of the three hooks in the family. The load runs across the weld, not around it.
- **Don't give the utility hooks a smaller structural chamfer to make them fit.** That
  was tried first: 1.5mm is the largest the old three-edge set allows at a 20mm cradle,
  and it builds. It also halves the relief on the family's most-loaded junction for no
  reason except that the kernel said so, and it leaves the hooks inconsistent with
  every other part. Relieving the weld alone keeps 3mm at any cradle width.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-26: the rest of the hook family arrives as variants, and the structural
  chamfer moves to the weld alone. Both utility hooks want a 20mm cradle on one
  bracket, which leaves 2.58mm of slab either side, and the old three-edge structural
  set needed 4mm of it. Geometry on this part is otherwise unchanged: same bounding
  box, same 6 slivers, 72mm3 less material where the two 6mm side chamfers were.
  Continuous dimensions became floats so the viewer's sliders move continuously.
- 2026-07-26: channel clearance 0.5 -> 0.3mm per side, from a printed calibration
  ladder. The first nurb print of this hook was loose side to side, and being a 1x it
  has only one channel constraining yaw. Geometry is otherwise untouched: same
  bounding box, same 6 slivers.
- 2026-07-25: ported to nurb. Geometry matches the Fusion v4 bounding box exactly
  (34 x 25.16 x 30mm) and the sliver baseline is unchanged at 6.

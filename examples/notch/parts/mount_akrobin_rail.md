Ported from Fusion `Mount - AkroBin Rail - 3x` v17.

## What it is

A continuous rail that hangs Akro-Mils AkroBins, and the knockoffs, on Wall Control by
their own moulded rear hanger lip. No bin modification and no part per bin. An 8.75mm
plate carries the dovetail channels; a 2.25 x 15mm rib runs along its top front edge.
The bin's lip drops over the rib, its hanger leg falls into the 6.5mm of open air behind
the rib, and the Wall Control sheet itself closes the back of that gap. Functionally it
is a louver, tab in front and pocket behind with a panel closing it, built out rather
than punched in. Bins hang anywhere along the rail and pack as tight as their own widths
allow.

It is also the only part in the library whose channels are not on adjacent brackets.
Three channels on a 4-bracket pitch span 226mm of wall, which is what makes it a rail
rather than a mount, and it is why `bracket_step` exists.

## Design notes

- **The 8.75mm standoff is the bin's number, not a choice.** The bin's back wall sits
  `leg thickness + slot width` forward of whatever the leg rests against, so
  `item_depth` is 2.75 + 6.0 and the signature says so. A real louvered panel beats it
  only because the leg passes through the punched sheet; Wall Control is solid behind,
  so 8.75mm is the physical minimum for any mount that uses the bin's own lip. Too small
  and the leg jams on the wall while the back wall floats with nothing bearing on it.
- **Three numbers came off Josh's bins with calipers on 2026-07-24**: the hanger leg is
  2.75mm thick by 10.75mm long and the slot is 6.0mm back wall to leg, and the lip runs
  the full bin width. They live in `measurements.toml` with how they were obtained and
  come in through `measured()`, because the bin is hardware in the same sense the bracket
  is: none of it can be derived, and a guess there produces a perfect model of the wrong
  object.
- **The full-width lip is why this is a plain rail and not a bracketed frame.** A frame
  would need bays wider than the bin, and a 105mm bin in a 6-slot bay leaves about 46mm
  of dead wall. With a rib the lip crosses a bracket freely, because the bracket lives
  below z=0 and the lip never goes there.
- **The rib is a ledge, not a plug.** It does not need to fill the slot. The bin is
  located by its back wall against the plate face and its leg against the wall; the rib
  only carries the lip's vertical load on its top edge, which is about 0.08 MPa over a
  bin's width. `rib_thickness` is the driver and `leg_gap` is derived from it, so the
  leg simply floats in a pocket deeper than it needs. Fit clearance that still matters
  is the leg's 2.75mm in a 6.5mm pocket; if a knockoff bin will not seat, the culprit is
  `item_depth`, not the pocket.
- **`rib_height` 15mm**: the top 10.75mm sits inside the bin's slot and the bottom
  4.25mm clears the structural chamfer at the root. The part raises if it drops below
  `10.75 + structural_chamfer + 2`.
- **This is one of the three parts that does not use `system.slab`**, and the reason is
  written into `slab`'s own docstring: the rib stands above z=0 and the channels run on a
  multiple of the pitch rather than on every bracket. `plate_width` does not generalise
  to a `bracket_step` either, so the y bounds are computed here.
- **Plate and rib are one extruded profile, not two bodies fused.** The front face comes
  out as a single unbroken plane from the rib top down to the bed, which is what the
  bin's back wall bears on over the full 55mm, and there is no weld to select against.
  Everything above z=0 behind the rib is the leg pocket, and there is nothing to model
  there.
- **Load path**: bin weight bears down on the rib's top edge as straight compression
  into the plate, and the forward moment presses the bin's back wall rearward against
  that one flush front face while the plate's back is already on the wall. No bending
  anywhere. `item_height` 40 sets the couple arm, 55mm rib top to bed, for a projection
  ratio of 0.16.
- **Relieve the back, never the front.** `relief_depth` 3.25mm comes off the back face
  between the bracket pads, open at the top and running out through the bottom edge, so
  it has no ceiling to bridge. The front is the bearing plane and stays one continuous
  surface. Wall contact is three pads totalling 1854mm2, about 0.04 MPa under two loaded
  bins.
- **`relief_depth` is deliberately decoupled from `leg_gap`.** They were the same number
  in Fusion until the rib was thinned, and leaving them tied would have driven the
  relief to 6.5mm and left a 2.25mm web that bows. The only real constraint is
  `relief_depth < leg_gap`, so the rib's rear face never overhangs the relief, and the
  part raises when it is violated.
- **`pad_width` is `BLOCK_WIDTH + 3`**, 28.16mm, which leaves 3.55mm of material either
  side of the 21.06mm dovetail. The pads stay full depth and full height because the
  channel has to run uninterrupted from the bottom edge up to the z=-3 stop, or the part
  will not slide onto the bracket. `_relief_bands` walks the run rather than assuming
  one gap per interval, so overlapping pads at a short `bracket_step` simply produce a
  solid back instead of an error.
- **Support-free, zero spans, verified by counting faces rather than by looking.** The
  only faces normal to z are the bed, the leg-pocket ledge, the rib top, three channel
  ceilings and the six detent dimple faces. Everything else is a constant-z extrusion.
  That holds at every parameter combination in the flex list below.
- **The chamfer selector is an allow-list and it has to be.** In Fusion it was a
  deny-list until the relief merged the rib's rear face and the relief's back face into
  one plane, the `ribrear` role stopped matching, the structural set came back empty and
  the kernel threw a bare "some input argument is invalid" on an empty collection. Here
  the pairs are named: cosmetic on front-ribtop, front-side, ribtop-side and
  ribrear-ribtop; structural on ribrear-platetop. Both sets raise a `ValueError` if they
  come back empty, and the roles are computed from the live parameters rather than from
  hardcoded x values, because thinning the rib moves its rear plane from -3.25 to -6.5
  and a frozen filter would go on matching nothing in silence.
- The allow-list is strictly narrower than `polish_edges`, so the four standing vetoes
  are satisfied by construction rather than by subtraction. The part asserts convexity on
  the polish set and concavity on the rib root anyway, since that is the one polish
  mistake that is invisible in code.
- **Sliver baseline is 2 faces at 0.866mm2**, the corner triangles at the rib's two
  top-front corners where three 1mm chamfers meet. Predicted from the allow-list before
  measuring and confirmed on the first build. It is 2 at every parameter combination
  tried, because the only place three chamfered edges meet is those two corners: the
  rib's top-rear corners have a sharp `ribrear`-`side` edge as their third, so the two
  bands miter and leave nothing behind.

### Kernel rules this part paid for

Both are the doctrine's "a chamfer needs room to land", at two different faces, and both
are exact to the last thousandth with no slack at all.

- **The rib top is the one face on this part carrying two chamfers**, one on its front
  edge and one on its rear, so `2 * chamfer_size < rib_thickness`, strictly. At the
  shipped 2.25mm rib and 1mm polish there is 0.25mm of flat left. Measured: builds at
  `rib_thickness` 2.005 with 0.005mm to spare, fails at 2.000 exactly; builds at
  `chamfer_size` 1.124, fails at 1.125. Fusion never met this because it thinned the rib
  from 5.5 to 2.25 without ever re-running the polish at a larger size.
- **A chamfer on a concave edge needs strictly more face than it takes.** The structural
  chamfer at the rib root lands on the leg-pocket ledge, which the relief has narrowed to
  `leg_gap - relief_depth` = 3.25mm. Measured: builds at 3.249, and at 3.250 exactly,
  where the chamfer's landing line touches the relief's back plane, OCCT raises "Failed
  creating a chamfer, try a smaller length value(s)". Both are guarded, so the OCCT
  message never reaches a user.

The Fusion card says a 3mm chamfer at the rib root "runs off into the back face". In
OCCT it does not: 3mm builds and leaves a 0.25mm strip of flat ledge. It runs off at
3.25 and only then does the kernel refuse. The conclusion is the same and the number is
0.25mm further out.

## Accepted

Two faces under 1mm2, both at 0.866mm2, and both are the corner triangles where three
1mm chamfers meet at a convex corner. That is the only tiny face the doctrine allows
outright. A third is a regression in the allow-list.

The thinnest section the ray cast finds is 1.98mm, on the channel's 45 degree dovetail
wall, and it is a diagonal across the corner to the back face rather than a wall. The
real minimum section is 3.75mm, behind the detent dimple: 8.75mm plate less the 4.2mm
channel less the 0.8mm dimple. The rib is 2.25mm, inside the doctrine's 2 to 3mm band.

This part was one of the two that retuned `concave_cosmetic`. On the first build the rule
fired at the 2mm structural chamfer at the rib root:

```
warn  concave_cosmetic     2.8mm strip sitting in a concave junction over 640.5mm2,
                           which is polish where a structural chamfer belongs
                           at (-5.5, 100.6, 1.0)
```

The limit was `2 * cosmetic_chamfer * 1.42` = 2.84mm and a 2mm chamfer leaves a 2.828mm
strip, so a structural chamfer at exactly twice the polish size sat inside the window by
a hundredth of a millimetre, at the very geometry the message tells you to use. The
chamfer could not grow, because the ledge it lands on is 3.25mm and it is already
relieving a 2.25mm rib. The limit is now `cosmetic_chamfer * 1.42 * 1.15`, so a
deliberate relief reads as one. Nothing about this part changed.

## Don't

- **Don't reintroduce the frame.** v1 and v2 were a skeletal frame, posts on the outside
  edges with the back relieved between them, chasing a 6mm standoff. Once the slot
  measured 6.0mm the target moved to 8.75mm, which is deeper than the plate, so the leg
  pocket sits in free air above the plate top and never fights the 4.2mm channel at all.
  Posts and bays solve a constraint that does not exist here.
- **Don't tune `item_depth` for looks.** It is 2.75 + 6.0 and the signature adds those
  two measurements rather than writing 8.75, so that anyone changing it has to argue with
  the bin.
- **Don't tie `relief_depth` to `leg_gap` again.** They were one number until the rib was
  thinned. Tying them drives the relief to 6.5mm and leaves a 2.25mm web that bows.
- **Don't perforate the web.** Five rounds of it in Fusion, v5 to v14, all removed. One
  big window per bay was lightest at 55.5 cm3 and left a 51.5mm bridge. Flat-top hex
  cells got the bridge to 8.24mm and read as pairs of holes separated by 28mm blanks.
  Cells on the wall's own 25.16mm pitch had even rhythm and still an 8.66mm lintel.
  Pointy-top hexes stretched to 45 degrees had zero bridges and staggered 45 degree
  honeycomb tessellated properly, and both were rejected on looks. Three things are worth
  keeping from it: a *regular* pointy-top hexagon is unprintable here, because its upper
  edges sit at 30 degrees from horizontal, a 60 degree overhang; at 45 degrees
  `lintel = width - height`, so adding rows makes bridging worse rather than better; and
  perforating the web is a look change, not a weight one, since the web is 5.5mm after
  the relief and every variant landed between 56 and 62 cm3 against 70.8 solid. The
  relief and the thin rib did all of the 33%.
- **Don't relieve the front.** The front face is the bin's bearing plane and has to stay
  one continuous unbroken surface. The relief hides against the wall.
- **Don't thicken the rib to make it fill the slot.** It was 5.5mm on the theory that a
  snug tab locates the bin. It does not, and thinning it to 2.25mm saved 11 cm3, more
  than every perforation attempt combined.
- **Don't give the rib root the family's 3mm structural chamfer.** The ledge behind the
  rib is only 3.25mm wide after the relief. 3mm builds and leaves 0.25mm of flat, which
  is under one extrusion width and not worth the 0.4 cm3. 2mm is the same call
  `Mount - Tape Measure - 2x` made.
- **Don't write the chamfer filter as a deny-list.** It is the single most expensive
  mistake this part made in Fusion, and it fails silently rather than loudly.
- **Don't add a comb web to join the channel cutters.** Fusion needed a fixed 16-lobe
  comb and an over-counted array because its combine tool lists never pick up new
  pattern instances. Here `channels` is a loop and eight disjoint tool bodies cut to one
  lump.
- **Don't chamfer the channel mouths or the detent dimple.** Standing vetoes for the
  whole library. The allow-list has no role for either, so they cannot get in by
  accident.
- **Don't ship the B depth variant yet.** Fusion left an open A/B print test on plate
  depth. A is 8.75mm with the relieved back, which is what this file is. B is 6.0mm
  solid, the family standard of a 4.2mm channel plus a 1.8mm wall, and it cannot be
  relieved: a 2.75mm web would bow and the rib-root ledge would drop under the 2mm
  chamfer. The arithmetic favours A. What stops the bin tipping on A is its back wall
  bearing on the plate face over 55mm, about 36N of rotation-stop force for a 2kg bin at
  100mm, against B's leg jamming on the wall over about 10mm at roughly 186N, five times
  as much, plus about 3.75mm of rock in the bin's own slot. B is 54.2 cm3 against A's
  60.3. A hang test settles it faster than the arithmetic does. B builds today as
  `mount_akrobin_rail(item_depth=6.0, relief_depth=0.0)`, which is 54.23 cm3 and one
  solid; if it wins, that becomes the default and this bullet becomes the changelog.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-26: ported to nurb from Fusion v17. Bounding box matches exactly at
  226.44 x 55.0 x 8.75mm and the 2-face sliver baseline reproduces on the first build.
  Volume is 60.29 cm3 against Fusion's 60.1, all of it the channel side clearance, which
  is 0.25mm per side here and was 0.5mm when Fusion measured. The same accounts for the
  pad area, 1854mm2 here against 1798mm2 there.

  What changed in the port. `ChannelArray`, `ChannelCut`, `DetentDimpleArray`,
  `ReliefArray` and the frozen over-counts collapse into three `system` calls and a list
  comprehension. `SlabProfile`, `Slab`, `RibProfile` and `Rib` collapse into one polygon,
  which is what makes the front face a single unbroken plane rather than two coplanar
  faces that OCCT would have to unify. The chamfer face-role filter is ported as written,
  as an allow-list deriving its planes from the live parameters. Two kernel limits that
  Fusion never surfaced are now guarded with their measured thresholds; see the design
  notes. `leg_gap` stays derived. `relief_depth` 4.5, which the Fusion card lists as
  flex-verified, is now refused: at the default 2mm chamfer it leaves exactly a 2.00mm
  ledge, and OCCT will not chamfer a face it exactly fills.

  Flexed `bracket_count` 3 to 5 to 2 to 1 to 3 and `bracket_step` 4 to 6 to 3 to 1 to 4,
  plus `rib_thickness` 2.25 to 3.0, `relief_depth` 3.25 to 4.0, `item_height` 40 to 30
  and `rib_height` 15 to 25. One solid, 2 slivers, channels on exact multiples of 25.16,
  pads tracking the bracket count, no horizontal face outside the six known kinds and
  `relief_depth < leg_gap` throughout. At `bracket_step` 1 the pads overlap and the back
  comes out solid, which is correct. At `bracket_count` 5 the rail is 428mm long and
  `nurb check` fails it on build volume against a 256mm bed, which is also correct.

Ported from Fusion `Shelf - Basic - 4x` v18.

## What it is

A four-bracket flat shelf: a 100mm platform with a 5mm front lip, carried on a 45mm
slab, with a gusset at each end. It is the plainest shelf in the library and the one
that carries the deepest cantilever, so it is where the reach-to-height arithmetic
actually bites.

## Design notes

- **The platform sits at the bottom of the slab**, so its underside is the build plate.
  That is what makes a 100mm shelf print support free, and it is also why there is no
  lightening in the model: ribs under the platform would be modelling detail into the
  first layer. Weight is a slicer infill setting here, not geometry.
- 106mm of reach over a 45mm back is a ratio of 2.36. That is inside the 2.5 limit and
  past 1.5, which is exactly the band the doctrine answers with end gussets. The 45mm
  slab is taller than the 28mm the brackets need for full engagement, and the extra
  17mm is what buys the ratio: height in the wall plane adds no forward mass.
- **The gussets are a true 45 degrees.** `gusset_depth` is derived rather than declared,
  as `item_height - shelf_thickness`, which is the rise from the platform top to the
  slab top. Setting the run equal to that rise is what makes the slope match every
  other facet on the part. Fusion reached this by way of a `shelf_depth / 2`
  half-projection heuristic that sat at about 38 degrees, and mismatched facet angles
  are a veto, so the heuristic went.
- Both sharp corners of that 39mm triangle get cut off. `gusset_tip` takes 6mm off the
  outer point, because a knife edge there is a sliver that carries no load. `gusset_drop`
  takes 3mm off the peak, for a kernel reason recorded under Don't. Both truncations
  come out of the run, so the gusset reaches 30mm forward of the slab and leaves 42.4mm
  of 45 degree slope.
- **A 45 degree gusset is only as deep as it is tall.** At the defaults that is the back
  30mm of a 100mm platform. This is a consequence of the facet standard rather than a
  defect: for more coverage, shorten `shelf_depth` or raise `item_height`, both of which
  keep the 45. Do not steepen the slope to reach further.
- The gussets are flush with the platform sides, so they read as side cheeks and their
  outer faces merge into the slab's own side faces. Nothing lands mid platform, where a
  gusset would divide the usable area.
- Structural relief is 3mm at the platform-to-slab junction and nowhere else. The
  gusset roots are concave too, but a gusset is 3mm thick and a 3mm chamfer would eat
  it. The junction edge comes from `new_edges`, so it stays correct as `bracket_count`
  moves; it is 94.64mm long at the defaults, which is the full width less the two
  gussets sitting on top of it.
- The cosmetic pass is 1mm on everything `polish_edges` allows, minus the structural
  chamfer's own edges and minus anything bounding a gusset's slope or its tip face.
  Those last are thin-web edges, where a chamfer leaves a runout rather than taking a
  corner off, and the doctrine's answer to a shape problem on a thin web is the profile.
- Verified: channel floors at x=-4.2 with y centers exactly 0, 25.16, 50.32 and 75.48,
  every floor the full 21.06mm span. Flexes 4 to 5 to 3 to 2 to 6 to 1 and back with the
  floors on exact pitch and the sliver baseline unchanged at every count.

## Accepted

Six faces under 1mm2, all of them 0.866mm2 corner triangles where three 1mm chamfers
meet at a convex corner, which is the only tiny face the doctrine allows outright. They
come in pairs, one per side: the slab's top front corners, and the lip's top back and
top front corners. A seventh means the polish pass has started cutting something it
should not.

The Fusion card recorded two, and the difference is real rather than a porting error.
Fusion's `Chamfer_Edges` was a hand-picked edge list and it did not include the two 3mm
edges along the ends of the lip's top face, so the lip's top ends were left sharp there.
Leaving that one edge out of this part's polish reproduces the Fusion number exactly,
2 faces at the slab corners and nothing at the lip. nurb selects by filter rather than
by list, so the lip's top ends get finished like everything else and the honest baseline
is 6.

The thinnest section is 1.00mm, behind a detent dimple: 6mm of slab less the 4.2mm
channel less the 0.8mm dimple. It is a consequence of the fit geometry rather than a
choice, and it is the same 1.0mm every part in this library carries.

## Don't

- **Don't set `gusset_drop` at or below `2 * chamfer_size`.** The gusset peak and the
  slab's top front edge both get polished, and if their chamfer bands touch, OCCT cannot
  build the corner and raises "Failed creating a chamfer, try a smaller length value(s)".
  Bisected here, the threshold is the chamfer exactly: at `chamfer_size` 0.5, 0.8, 1.0
  and 1.25 the part fails at `gusset_drop` 1.0, 1.6, 2.0 and 2.5 and builds just above
  each. Do not just shrink the chamfer when it fails; the two move together. 3mm is the
  default because clearing the threshold is not enough on its own: at 2.05 to 2.2 the
  part builds but the corner faces get squeezed to 0.778mm2 and the sliver count goes to
  8. It settles back to 6 from 2.3 up.
- **Don't run `gusset_drop` to zero to recover the lost 3mm of reach.** It builds, and it
  is wrong twice over. The gusset then tapers to a zero thickness feather at the top
  layer, and the slab's top front edge is interrupted by two 135 degree segments that
  cannot be polished, so the part's top edge is chamfered in the middle and sharp at
  both ends.
- **Don't raise `chamfer_size` to 1.5.** The lip's top face is 3mm wide and two 1.5mm
  chamfers need strictly more than 3mm between them. Measured: `lip_thickness` 3.0 fails
  and 3.05 builds. This is the same rule as `gusset_drop` at a second site, and both are
  guarded, so it fails with a sentence rather than the bare OCCT message.
- **Don't put the platform anywhere but the bottom of the slab.** Raising it puts a
  100mm unsupported ledge in the air. The whole part is arranged around printing flat.
- **Don't add underside ribs or any other lightening.** The platform's underside is the
  bed contact face and a flat shelf has no top surface to rib either. This was decided
  in Fusion and it still holds.
- **Don't add a `gusset_count`.** The Fusion part carries one because the shelf family
  shares a template, and its only shipped value is 2. Anything above 2 puts a fin mid
  platform, which the doctrine vetoes outright: it divides the usable area. A parameter
  with one legal value is the same dead weight `fillet_size` was.
- **Don't set `gusset_depth` by hand.** It is derived so that the slope cannot drift off
  45. Raise `item_height` if the gusset needs to be bigger.
- **Don't add a debossed label.** Retired in Fusion on 2026-07-24 and forbidden by the
  doctrine: the file name carries catalog identity.
- **Don't chamfer the channel mouths, the back face or the bottom edges.** Bottom
  chamfers were deleted from this part in Fusion on 2026-07-22 because tiny facets on a
  bracket-mount bottom edge print badly. `polish_edges` already excludes all three.
- **Don't hang this off one bracket.** It builds at any `bracket_count` and there is no
  guard, because nothing about it fails geometrically. A 106mm reach on a single 25mm
  channel twists under any off-center load, and the doctrine's answer to torsion is
  another mount point. Four is what ships.
- **Don't drop `item_height` to the 30mm light-part default.** The ratio goes to 3.5 and
  `nurb check` says so. Past 2.5 the fix is a taller back, not a bigger gusset.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-26: ported to nurb. The bounding box matches Fusion v18 exactly, 106 x 100.64
  x 45mm at a 2.36 ratio. Three changes came out of the port. `fillet_size` is gone; it
  was a remnant of the fillet era and nothing read it. `gusset_count` is gone for the
  same reason, with the doctrine's mid-surface veto behind it. `gusset_drop` is new and
  is the only geometry change: OCCT cannot chamfer a gusset peak that lands on the slab
  top's polish band, so the peak stops 3mm short, which costs 3mm of the gusset's
  forward reach and keeps the 45. The sliver baseline is 6 rather than the 2 the Fusion
  card recorded, for the reason under Accepted.

Ported from Fusion `Bin - Small Parts - 3x` v27.

## What it is

The first bin in the library: an open-top cup for screws, bits and small hardware.
Three dovetail channels hang it on the brackets and the slab is the back wall, so the
contents rest against the wall itself, the same move the tape mount and the pliers
holder make. The floor sits on the bed, four walls rise, the top is open, so it prints
support-free with no corbel anywhere.

The front wall is dropped 20mm and the two side walls taper down at 45 degrees to meet
it. That is what lets you see into the cup and scoop over the front instead of fishing
over a full-height square wall. A 5mm fillet on the inner front-floor corner lets small
parts sweep out instead of jamming in a sharp crease.

It is the lead part of a size family. `bracket_count` flexes the width and nothing
else: 2x for a small cup, 3x for the everyday one, 4x for a wide bin at 100.6mm, which
is the smallest common Akro-Mils footprint.

## Design notes

- **The cavity stops at the slab front, x = -6, not at the body's back face at -5.**
  This is the load-bearing dimension on the part. The channel floor is at x=-4.2, so a
  cavity back at -6 leaves a 1.8mm web behind each channel, the same web the pliers
  holder carries. The Fusion original pulled it to -5 for one version, left 0.8mm, and
  the detent dimple cut straight through into the interior. `bin_overlap` is only the
  body's overlap into the slab, to make the two interpenetrate so they fuse to one
  solid; the cavity does not use it.
- **The body is a solid block hollowed out, not four walls assembled.** One `Box` and
  one cut instead of Fusion's profile-and-extrude pair, and the walls cannot drift out
  of agreement with each other.
- **The taper runs to the front wall's outer edge and the front drop is interior
  only.** The taper is a 45 degree cut, run equal to rise, landing on the front face at
  z=-20. For that to read as one clean diagonal down to the front corner, the front
  wall is lowered only between the side walls, its y-range inset by `wall_thick` each
  side. Lower it across the full width instead and the side-wall fronts flatten to
  z=-20 while the ramp still sits above them until the very front edge, which leaves a
  2.5mm step. Two dead ends got to this form; see Don't.
- **Cut the taper two-sided.** `extrude(section, width / 2 + 1, both=True)` from
  `Plane.XZ` at the bracket run's midpoint. A one-directional extrude from a section on
  y=0 reaches the far side wall and silently leaves the near one a hard 90 degrees. That
  version builds, exports and looks correct from one side, which is why the Fusion card
  spends a bullet on it.
- **The side walls are the gussets.** They are full-height vertical webs joining the
  floor to the slab. At a projection-to-height ratio of 1.08 the doctrine asks for
  chamfers only, so the one structural feature is the 3mm chamfer at the floor-to-slab
  corner, which is where a full cup of hardware pries the floor away from the wall.
  Front and interior corners are light-load.
- **The footprint is `bracket_count * BLOCK_WIDTH` and cannot flare past it**, because
  the body is built from the slab's own y-range rather than from a width parameter.
  Anything wider clips the next bracket's comb lobe. To get a bigger bin, add a
  bracket.
- Interior is 56.5mm deep by 70.5mm wide by 57mm tall at the back.
- **The cosmetic pass is 9 edges, chosen by which faces meet, not by size.** The bin's
  outside is three kinds of face: the front and the two flanks (OUTER), anything
  looking up (TOP), and the two ramps (TAPER). Bevel every edge where two of them meet
  and drop the TOP/TAPER pair, and the count falls out: 2 front vertical corners, 3
  TOP/OUTER (the two top rims and the front wall's own rim at z=-20), 4 OUTER/TAPER
  (the two taper slopes and the two ramp fronts). The cavity rim stays sharp because an
  inner wall is none of those three.
- **The polish runs in two chamfer calls, and it has to.** See Don't for the rule. The
  wrap around the ramp's front corner cannot be cut on a clean body at any length.
- Verified: channel floors at x=-4.2 with y-centers exactly 0, 25.16 and 50.32, every
  floor the full 21.06mm span. Flexes 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 with the sliver baseline
  unchanged, and builds at 1 through 6 brackets.

## Accepted

No faces under 1mm², which is what the Fusion part recorded and the reason to trust
that the polish set matches. It is not luck: the three bevels that meet at each front
ramp corner meet along shared edges rather than at a point, so there is no corner
triangle, and the ramp-front bevel comes out at 3.10mm² because the edge it lands on is
a 135 degree junction rather than a square one. A part with a face under 1mm² here is a
regression in the polish selection, not a rounding difference.

The thinnest section is 1.0mm, behind the detent dimple: 6mm slab less the 4.2mm
channel less the 0.8mm dimple. Same number as every other part in the library, and it
is a consequence of the fit geometry rather than a choice.

```

## Don't

- **Don't pull the cavity back to the body's back face.** At `item_depth - bin_overlap`
  the web behind each channel is 0.8mm and the detent dimple goes through it into the
  interior. The cavity back belongs at `-item_depth` and nowhere else.
- **Don't lower the front wall across the full width.** It was tried, and it flattens
  the side-wall fronts to z=-20 while the ramp still runs above them, so the ramp lands
  on a flat and leaves a `wall_thick` step at the front. That is what the Fusion part
  shipped from v11 until v19.
- **Don't land the taper on the front wall's inner edge either.** That was the v19 fix
  and it is clean, but it leaves a small lip standing across the front. Taper to the
  outer edge plus an interior-only front drop is the final form and there is no third
  option that was not tried.
- **Don't chamfer the TOP/TAPER junction.** Where each ramp meets the top face is a
  `wall_thick` sliver of an edge, 2.5mm at the default, and Fusion failed on it with
  `ASM_BL_CAP_COMPLEX`. OCCT will build it, which is worth knowing, but it puts a bevel
  on a 2.5mm stub between two junctions that are already beveled and it reads as
  noise. It stays sharp on purpose.
- **Don't try to cut all 9 cosmetic bevels in one `chamfer` call.** The two where the
  ramp lands on the front face fail on a clean body at every length from 2.4mm down to
  0.05mm, so shrinking the chamfer never gets there. The inner end of each is a point
  where four faces meet but only three edges do: the front face and the side wall's
  inner face touch there without sharing an edge, because the front drop and the ramp
  land at the same z by design. OCCT has no cap for that corner. Chamfering the other
  seven first takes the front rim's bevel down past that point, which gives those two
  faces a real 1mm edge between them, and then the wrap builds. Two calls, and the
  second one re-selects its edges from the result.
- **Don't polish the cavity rim.** The top of a side wall is `wall_thick` across, so
  bevels on its inner and outer edges would leave a 0.5mm strip between them, which is
  under the `2 * chamfer_size` the kernel needs and is a sliver even where it builds.
- **Don't widen the bin without adding a bracket.** The footprint is the slab's, and
  anything past `bracket_count * BLOCK_WIDTH` clips the next comb lobe on the wall.
- **Don't chamfer the detent dimple or the channel mouths.** Standing library vetoes;
  `polish_edges` already excludes them.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-26: ported to nurb. Bounding box matches the Fusion v27 exactly
  (75.48 x 60 x 65mm) and the 0-sliver baseline reproduces with the same 9 cosmetic
  edges. Two things changed. The 9 bevels are now two `chamfer` calls instead of
  Fusion's one feature, because OCCT refuses the ramp-front wrap on a clean body at
  any length; the Fusion card's "build it as one feature from a clean body" rule was
  about a corrupting retry loop and does not transfer. And the edge selection is by
  face pair rather than by a length threshold plus an exception, which is what the
  Fusion selection was approximating.

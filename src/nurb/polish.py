"""The polish pass: chamfer as much of a set as the kernel will take.

`chamfer` is all or nothing. One edge that cannot land takes the whole call down, and
the natural response is to shrink the set by hand until it builds. That is how a part
with ninety exposed edges ends up with three chamfered ones, and it is why the same
doctrine produces far more chamfers in a GUI, where a human adds them one feature at a
time and works around each collision individually.

The doctrine describes this algorithm and used to leave every project to write it. It
was 35 lines in one `system.py`, which meant the next project would write it again or,
far more likely, skip it and hand-narrow the set, which is exactly what the rule exists
to prevent.

    worse, because a 0.4mm chamfer lands and then reads as a defect on the print.

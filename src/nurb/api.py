"""The vocabulary a part file gets, printed with signatures.

`from nurb import *` hands a part file the whole build123d namespace plus a handful of
names of nurb's own. The doctrine names those in prose and gives no signatures, so an
agent that wants to know what `concave_edges` returns goes and reads the installed
source to find out. In one recorded session that was ten of thirty-eight shell commands,
and reading source is the most expensive way for a model to answer a question it could
have been told in thirty lines.

Nurb's own names are derived, never listed: they are whatever `__init__` adds on top of
build123d, so this cannot drift from what a part file can actually call. The signatures
and the summaries come off the functions themselves for the same reason.

# documentation and does not belong here.

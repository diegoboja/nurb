"""Named real-world values, with provenance.

The bottleneck on a one-off part is not geometry, it is dimensions. An agent cannot
measure a freezer shelf, and a guessed number produces a perfect model of the wrong
object: it builds, it checks clean, and it prints. Nothing downstream catches it.

So a measurement is a named value on disk with a note saying how it was obtained, and
asking for one that is not on file raises. That failure is the feature. It is the moment
to ask rather than to pick something plausible.

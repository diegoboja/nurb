"""Write parameter values back into a part's keyword defaults.

The keyword defaults are the parameters, so an exploration that ends up in the source
has to end up in the signature. This rewrites exactly the defaults it was asked to and
nothing else: the source is edited as text at the offsets the parser reports, so
comments, formatting and every other line survive untouched. Source in, source out; the
caller decides what to do with it, which in v2 is a new revision row.

No card here: v2 has no variants, so there is nothing of a card to edit.

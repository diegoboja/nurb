"""A mesh as a part's starting solid, in the one case where it can be one.

`import_stl` is the name a model reaches for the moment a downloaded file lands in a
project, and build123d's returns a `Face`: a triangulated sheet with no inside.
Subtracting from one does not raise, it segfaults, so the build process dies with no
traceback at all. An error that kills the loop and prints nothing is the worst one this
codebase can produce, which is what makes this import worth owning.

What it can honestly do is narrow, because a mesh carries no design. A wall thickness
in an STL is a distance between two sheets of triangles, not a number anyone can
change, so nothing here recovers a parameter. What does survive is flat faces, and
those survive exactly: a box returns as six planar faces at its original size, an
L-bracket as fourteen, a box already chamfered as twenty-six, and every one of those
faces chamfers again. Curves do not survive at all. A cylinder returns as a 126-sided
prism with no circular edge left to select, so the selector that would grab its rim
finds nothing, and a 3mm fillet becomes nine thousand facets.

So the flat-faced case returns a solid and everything else is refused by name, pointing
at measurement. Measuring the file and rebuilding it in code is the only path that ends
with parameters, and a part with parameters is the whole point.

"""The card's AUTO block: what a build measures, written back next to the prose.

A card is the readable, months-later context for a part. Most of it is hand-authored,
and one fenced region is not: the facts that only come from actually building the thing.

Two rules make the block trustworthy. It is regenerated, never hand-edited, so it cannot
disagree with the geometry. And it carries no timestamp, so regenerating it on unchanged
geometry produces no diff, which is what makes a regeneration safe to run at any time and a
stale card visible in `git diff`.

It deliberately does not repeat the parameters. Keyword defaults are the parameters and
the part file is readable text, so copying them here would be the parallel `PARAMS` dict
the contract forbids, one level removed. The block holds what you cannot get by reading
the source.
